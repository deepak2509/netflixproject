STRAW,movies,Straw,"No offence but i really feel the way he reveals the delusions shes been having at the end was pretty cheap and just bad writing in general. Usually when you want to do something like this, you leave clues here and there for the possibility of this being the case, tv shows like the boys, fight club, mr robot, are among some of the shows that have managed to do this perfectly. In this movie, it doesnt make sense, the parts where she is having conversations about her daughter are meant to actually line up with what is being said, for example the scene with the principle and them wanting to take her daughter away, she has delusions.. not amnesia, in the reveal of how that principal scene actually goes at the end, its such a brief conversation, and the case worker that was originally there to take away her kid, wasnt even there to begin with. Now if you really wanted to do something like this and show that she really imagined her daughter was there the whole time, then nothing from that principal scene should have been different except her daughter not being present, if you've ever seen Mr robot or fight club, you know exactly what i am talking about, the scene remains unchanged, but now we see what everyone else saw, here instead what happens is that its a different scene entirely from what we were told.

Another issue I have with the show is probably what I have with a lot of tyler perry movies, or just movies of this nature... Almost all the characters are unreasonable and most of this would never play out this way but Perry likes to portray it like its a common occurrence. A cop isnt getting mad you cut him off and then trying to drive you off the road for it, and then trying to get you killed for it. It just seems like he dialed up every ridiculous stereotype to 1000. There was nothing for me to cry about in this movie because it just felt ridiculously unrealistic, like no one acts like this in real life Tyler, and for heavens sake, write a different kind of black women, it cant always be the stereotype of a black women struggling to make ends meet with 2+ jobs.

  
TLDR: Tyler Perry sucks at foreshadowing (imo), he grossly magnifies certain stereotypes that honestly do more harm than good to their respective communities, and overall the writing for the movie was just pretty weak (imo)",48,0.054315476,0.483452381,6/8/25 20:43

STRAW,netflix,Straw is one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen.,"The movie makes sense when you look at it from a psychological standpoint where one straw broke the camels back‚Ä¶as the saying goes. You can‚Äôt fully understand the movie until you finish it. 

The movie is NOT actually framed about events of just a few hours. It‚Äôs about a lifetime of never being able to keep up. More Americans are living one paycheck away from financial RUIN and have for some time now‚Ä¶only inflation is making things worse. Tariffs are making things worse. Rising COL is making things worse. Pre-COVID you could survive off of 40k a year. Now you need 70k just to qualify for housing WITH A ROOMMATE in some low/moderate COL locations. Year after year trying to make ends meet but only falling farther behind while people across of that retail counter treat you like a subpar human being on the daily. It beats you up. It breaks you down. 

Then add a medically fragile child. 

After years of the struggle‚Ä¶let‚Äôs say 5 since we are 5yrs post-COVID your precious child passes away. It‚Äôs enough to make anyone break. Hell, I had a mental breakdown when my dad died leaving me parentless at 19yes old. A breakdown looks different for everyone. For the main character, that meant blacking out that her child was gone, and seeing everyone and the world against her. Some true. Some more exaggerated. This was my experience‚Ä¶ only I had wolves around me (everyone wanted a piece of the inheritance pie when I was just trying to bury my father and his ONLY next of kin). 

Is the writing overdone? Maybe. 
Is all the acting bad? Up to interpretation. 
However, when you look at our poor health system, and even worse mental health system‚Ä¶ you cannot imagine how this chain of events or similar scenarios can actually happen‚Ä¶and quite quickly. It only takes one straw to break the camels back. 

If you cannot imagine stuff like this happening, then congratulations‚Ä¶consider yourself privileged. You missed the entire point of the entire movie and lack the mental and/or emotional capacity to see beyond what you wanted to see.",11,-0.040972222,0.461597222,6/15/25 19:09

Search the term submarine failures. 

Everything inside of the sub would compress immediately. That rapid compression would generate so much heat it would be almost as hot at the sun. That compressed package of atoms would then explode outwards against the pressure of the ocean. It would expand to a similar but slightly smaller size as the original sub. Then the entire thing would compress again. That compression would generate enough heat and force to overcome the compression of the ocean and explode outwards again. Eventually the ocean would win but there would be vacillations between fully compressed and fully exploded, in an ever decreasing size.

That later moment in Jerusalem where they just about get into a building and the horde behind them slam into the wall like a wave was terrifying.

World War Z,movies,The Wall Scene of 'World War Z' kills me inside every single time,"The final act of that movie was a giant rewrite after they realized the original ending didn‚Äôt work at all.  IIRC, after Israel he goes to Russia and gets conscripted into their zombie fighting force, his wife thinks he died and sells herself into sexual servitude to a military guy in order to survive in the refugee camp she and her kids get dumped in. Pitt gets in touch finally and her new man tells him to stay where he is and start a new life like he has with Pitt‚Äôs wife. Pitt isn‚Äôt having it, so he and the Israeli soldier and a few of his new friends fight their way to a place so Pitt can make it back to America, but the only way they can find is a boat that leaves him in Oregon. The entire movie ends on a sequel setup where Pitt and his pals have to make their way across zombie-infested America to Florida, so that Pitt can reclaim his family. 

Even though the plane crash happening a convenient distance from a critical WHO zombie research facility setup is clunky, I still admire that they were able to salvage the movie in reshoots, because that sounds all kinds of bad.",292,0.049005682,0.616477273,1/29/22 20:15

My theory is that the switchblade is a retractable one and its just fake blood. Plus with all the cctv going on, they have to fake it till the end. Because if its not it is kinda dumb that they really went in with no plan.

Also Tom suddenly going to Hayley Atwell (as much as I love her due to captain america) just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Same with James Bond and the last bond girl (as much as I love lea sedoux).

Especially given the history of the female leads being replaced time and time again. Ilsa was the first one who stayed on. 

I also think Ilsa deserved a better send off. Giving her so little to do in her limited screen time was insulting after we invested in the character's journey. 

They could have had her be the main lead in the first and 2nd act and then kill her off. That would have been a lot better than her being sidelined as a background character for the majority of her screen time. Even her main fight with Gabriel was underwhelming because it felt forced.

The action scenes are generally all great, but not quite as mindblowing as Fallout, and it‚Äôs not a fault of the movie but I do feel like having the big stunt in the promotions be the climax, as opposed to early in the movie as has been the case with the last few, robs it of some impact.

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning,TrueFilm,Was anyone else underwhelmed by Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning?,"Is there a liver strong enough to survive taking a shot every time the word key is mentioned?  

Fallout imo is the crown jewel of the series and my favorite movie of 2018.  My expectations were definitely too high.  I still had fun and will ultimately hold reservations until I see the other half but I did not get the sense of needing to see it again like so many other entries in the series.

Ever since JJ gave the series a new direction I thought the exposition was handled well in each installment and fed into the action in a meaningful way.  Dead Rrckoning is the first time I felt like the cohesion of exposition and action wasn't there.  

The biggest disappointment for me is how poorly the main stunt was handled.  I don't know if it's the build up (or lack there of) leading into the stunt or how it was edited but I didn't feel like the spectacle of the stunt was properly conveyed in the movie. It came off as abrupt.  I guess it didn't help that the landing of the stunt was played for a surprise entrance joke.",21,0.061073781,0.487444005,7/26/23 21:00

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning,TrueFilm,Was anyone else underwhelmed by Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning?,"Oh man, beyond underwhelmed. It felt like such a giant step back for the franchise. 

- It felt detached from the prior installments, almost as if the last six movies never happened, or the people making it never saw them. 
- Characters and their motivations seemed totally reset and they were dispatched with abandon.
- It looked *awful*. ‚ÄúWhen in doubt, Dutch the close-up‚Äù should not be the mantra when placing the camera. The camera seemed like it was trying to pickup the considerable slack left by the script and failing dramatically. Exposition scenes are about 10 minutes too long so just start jumping the 180 and cut, cut, cut. Lighting was straight up nasty and the makeup did not do the actors any favors.
- Fight choreography went from world class in Fallout to daytime television levels of bad.
- The villains were lame and unauthentic challenges for Ethan.
- Somehow Tom Cruise felt like Tom Cruise and not like Ethan Hunt, more than any other installment.
- The stunt was impressive in real life but totally uninventive compared to the last few big ones they‚Äôve done. He just‚Ä¶parachutes off a cliff? It wasn‚Äôt even worked into the story in a clever way.
- Every category of action was done better in a previous movie: MI:1 had a better top-of-train thing, MI:2 and Rogue Nation had better motorcycle scenes, MI:4 had a better sandstorm scene, they‚Äôve all had better gunfights, etc.
- Every mask-pull was 100% predictable.
- Wow Ilsa really died like a punk. We‚Äôve also seen her fight and kill dozens of way-more-badass enemies than‚Ä¶what even was his name?
- 3 hour runtime totally unjustifiable when it was so annoyingly padded with crap exposition and overlong, boring dialogue.
- Tacked on, never-before-mentioned (I think) backstory between Ethan, his pre-IMF lover, and the villain was so phony.

I‚Äôm shocked this movie isn‚Äôt getting more backlash in the reviews and box office, it was really really not a good one.",17,-0.050625,0.520625,7/29/23 23:05
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning,TrueFilm,Was anyone else underwhelmed by Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning?,"I was disappointed, and I think I might just be running out of enthusiasm for their formula. I loved 4-6, but the hype cycle for this movie meant that it couldn't surprise me like the previous films did. Feels like they're starting to run out of gas.

My biggest disappointment was that the big stunt set pieces, which are the hallmark of the series, weren't as memorable and striking as the Burj Khalifa climb, Casablanca chase, Paris chase, HALO jump, or helicopter battle from previous movies. It felt like they were saving some of their best ideas for part 2, or that COVID hampered what they could do.",42,0.101666667,0.478333333,7/26/23 13:46
Fear Street: Prom Queen,Fear_Street,fear street prom queen was disappointing,"Yes, it felt super disconnected.

Fear Street: Prom Queen,Fear_Street,fear street prom queen was disappointing,"The thing I appreciated most about the Fear Street trilogy was how much I grew to care about the characters in every movie. Of course I cared about Josh, Sam and Deena but I also loved characters like Kate, Alice, and Simon. The characters in the Fear Street trilogy felt grounded in reality and easy to understand, even if you couldn't relate to them personally or if they were a bully. I don't feel like I connected to any of the characters in Fear Street: Prom Queen and that's really sad to me. 

There's no real substantial building on the lore we explored in the trilogy, or really much about the systemic differences between Shadyside and Sunnyvale. Which really sucks because I think there was a lot of potential with the Shadyside self-improvement arc they alluded to in this movie. 

It also felt like the time period wasn't really much of a factor in a lot of the outfits, hair, set design, etc. I think the main character's best friend has a bridge piercing? Bridge piercings are awesome, don't get me wrong, but the idea of a teenager in the 80s having a bridge piercing at school and not getting dresscoded to hell and back is jarring to me.

I know this is a standalone movie in the Fear Street universe, but it feels so divorced from the things that made the original trilogy so enjoyable.",22,0.214473684,0.506140351,5/23/25 13:18

Fear Street: Prom Queen,Fear_Street,fear street prom queen was disappointing,"Yeah, I agree, I was disappointed. The opening voiceover was a huge exposition dump that was rushed and lazy. I didn‚Äôt understand characters or relationships or motivations at all beyond their apparent baseline cliches. Dialogue was cringe, poorly written, and poorly directed. The foundational ‚Äúwhodunnit‚Äù mystery was really underdeveloped. Red herrings not adequately set up. Whole setup of the prom was nonsensical. I understand it was the ‚Äò80s and teens were undersupervised, but it really seemed like characters were wandering off for no reason and no one noticed or cared, and it‚Äôs kind of really important for both the protagonists and the audience to have at least some hints about who is where, when, and why. Kills were sudden and gory, which is maybe its one strength, but it lacked a lot of style and I didn‚Äôt know or care enough about any of the victims for their deaths to be cathartic in any way. 

I was hoping for two critical elements of Prom Night to be included, an excessively long dance sequence and a jallo chase sequence. We kind of got both, but holy hell the dancing was bad and awkward, and the jallo chase sequence was missing some crucial components (particularly with lighting, framing, and a bloody kill at the end, really it should have been one of the other girl victims who got this prolonged chase ending in her death, like Melissa) and was really more of a final girl(s?) circuit. 

Unfortunately this wasn‚Äôt bad in a campy and funny kind of way, it was just bad in a boring kind of way. I really wanted to like this because I loved the trilogy but this just falls short.",11,-0.056875,0.629791667,5/23/25 12:34

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,entertainment,"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, review: 'The most numbingly moronic film of 2023... Clumps of my brain were giving up in disgust'","**From The Telegraph's Robbie Collin:**

Some films are so stupid you can swear individual brain cells are dying as you watch them. Then there is Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, during which it felt like entire clumps of grey matter were giving up the gig in disgust and abseiling out of my ears.

With mere days to go until the turn of the calendar, here arrives the most numbingly moronic film of 2023: a second solo outing for Jason Momoa‚Äôs beefy merman, of the now-disbanded 2010s screen incarnation of DC‚Äôs Justice League.

The previous Aquaman wasn‚Äôt good either, but it was made with the sort of sunny brainlessness that travelled well. Of its $1.1 billion global takings in 2018, almost a third came from China, while it was Romania‚Äôs favourite film of the entire 2010s.

Presumably in an effort to match this success, the sequel is essentially the CG equivalent of having an air horn blown in your face for two hours.

Its plot ostensibly concerns a magical substance called orichalcum ‚Äì which, unless you happen to be a classicist, is the latest movie-franchise word you will hear 500 times in the space of 120 minutes and then never again for the rest of your life.

But all it really involves is Jason Momoa‚Äôs Aquaman hurtling through a string of unreadably messy computer-generated battle scenes, rendered in some of the ugliest colour combinations allowed by the visible spectrum.

In the same way that some films leave you with a lingering dislike of a certain actor or director, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom sends you from the cinema with a profound and furious hatred of green.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,MovieDetails,"In Aquaman (2018), Aquaman mind controls the shark cavalry to turn against their riders. By Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023), Atlantis has switched to robotic sharks","Aquaman must seem absolutely terrifying to the other Atlanteans. In the first movie he initially appears to them as a usurper of the throne who has come to stop Atlantis from waging a war of self-defense against the surface world. He shows up at a pivotal battle between Atlantis and her allies against the Brine Kingdom, and doesn‚Äôt take sides but instead indiscriminately massacres everyone in sight almost as a show of force.

He is riding the Karathen, which is a nightmarishly massive beast from legend, and commands an army of Trench, who are the Atlanteans‚Äô devolved bestial cousins and represent one the most shameful and dark parts of Atlantis‚Äôs history. Atlantis currently uses the Trench to execute or sacrifice high value political prisoners, including Aquaman‚Äôs mother (so Atlantis believes). Thus Aquaman using the Trench to deliver his vengeance upon Atlantis must seem like a perverse reversal of power structures between Atlantis and the Kingdom of the Trench. The Atlanteans must be terrified that Aquaman has come to devolve them to a state similar to how the Trench are now.

In addition, Aquaman telepathically controls a mob of sea creatures to attack Atlantis‚Äôs armies through some sort of hellish puppeteering. He even uses this power to command the shark cavalry to attack their own riders - soldiers who have trained alongside these animals for years are suddenly being ripped apart by their loyal steeds.

Finally, he wields the trident and armor of King Atlan himself. Of course, the audience knows that he is able to do so because he is the ‚Äúone true king‚Äù, yet to the other Atlanteans - who believe Orm is their king - he must seem like some sort of antichrist, wearing Atlan‚Äôs regalia as a cruel mockery of everything that Atlantis stands for. After humiliating their king in single combat, Aquaman then strongarms the rest of the Atlanteans into either accepting him as their king, or violating their most sacred laws. After massacring hundreds of his ‚Äúown‚Äù troops, he forces the surviving Atlanteans to applaud his coronation while still drenched in their comrades‚Äô blood. His first decree as king of Atlantis is not for his own kingdom‚Äôs sake, but rather that of the surface world, as he calls off the war.

At the end of the battle, the other Atlanteans must think of him as a terrorist and an agent of the surface world at best, and as an antichrist with demonic reality-bending powers at worst.

*Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom* shows that there are still plenty in Atlantis who want to eradicate the surface world, namely the Council of Houses (Atlantis‚Äôs second most powerful political entity after the throne). The fact that the Atlantean shark riders now use robotic sharks instead of organic ones exemplifies this. In what country is military innovation motivated by countering the tactics employed by that country‚Äôs own king?

That being said, I loved the first film and feel like it gets too much hate. It wasn‚Äôt a masterpiece of cinema by any means, the writing and acting were horrendous. But a certain tempering of expectations is necessary when you watch a movie called ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù where a giant shark fights a giant crab. The first movie had very entertaining visual design, art style, cinematography, worldbuilding, action, and an incredible soundtrack, it just rippled my nipples in a very particular and subjective way. It ticked most of the boxes that I expect from a superhero/action film.

The second one was not as good, it didn‚Äôt deliver as much on these points while continuing the flaws of the first film (the audio mixing and delivery was so bad that certain actors like Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard at times didn‚Äôt even sound like native English speakers).

It also butchered Nereus's (Dolph Lundgren's) character. In the first film he hates the surface world as much as Orm does, to the point where he is willing to ally Xebel with Atlantis even though he is fully aware that Orm staged a false flag attack to manipulate him into cooperating. His big character development moment is when he begrudgingly accepts Aquaman as king of Atlantis after seeing him with King Atlan's trident. Yet in the second film he now hates Orm and is very vocal about his mistrust for him, and acts as if he supported Aquaman from the beginning.

I‚Äôm sure a large part of the second film's flaws is because of a messy production and filming, but some of it may have been James Wan phoning it in while knowing that the DCEU was coming to a close. I don‚Äôt particularly care if Jason Momoa comes back in the Gunnverse, but I hope that Gunn‚Äôs Aquaman is not a complete 180 from Wan‚Äôs.",998,0.116974603,0.483883598,9/17/24 12:32

I saw this on a lark with a friend and we both ended up having such a blast watching it. 

Legitimately forgot how god awful my life's been lately and made me remember I really only do have this one life. It's time to start living like it again. 

Remembered that it's an animated film and the camera is free to do whatever you want it to do. And the action sequences were spectacular.

Basically a western about an old cowboy facing death it's a perfect movie and it hit every single beat it tried for without being embarrassed about getting too emotional by throwing in some pointless joke to cheapen the sentiment. 

Honestly. Very refreshing after what a let down Babylon was.",2703,0.142945326,0.597398589,12/22/22 1:24

Instant Family,Adoption,Just saw Instant Family - struggling to understand Lizzys psychology,"I can tell you that when we watched this movie with our adopted kids (all teens, adopted as tweens), my daughter totally identified with Lizzy.  She was 11 when we adopted her.  She said ""I was just like her!  I HATED y'all!""  I found Lizzy to be very, very realistic.   Her motivations are complex.  Part of it is that she is afraid to trust the Wagners, and assumes they will get rid of her, so she tries to push them away.  If it can be her choice, not theirs, she won't feel as hurt and rejected.  That's what she is doing at the end when she tells them to keep Juan and Lita and find her a new placement.   She does want to be with them, desperately, but she thinks they won't want her.  She also really grieves for her mom and wants to be able to be reunited with her.  I think the movie did a great job of showing that she can really love and want her mother, and also really want and love the Wagners.  People are complicated, those two things aren't a contradiction at all.  

She is also angry at everything she has been through, and is taking it out on them because they are nearby and are safe - she knows they won't abuse her so she feels safe to let some anger out.  Part of trauma informed parenting is understanding that this will happen, a LOT of this, and that it's actually a good sign that the child is feeling safe enough to mouth off to you.  Also some of what she did was 100% normal teenager stuff!  Talking bratty to mom?  Sneaking friends in?  Trying to wear inappropriate outfits?  All normal teenager behavior.

If you want to adopt and can't get your mind around Lizzy, you really may not be ready to understand where adopted kids are coming from.",10,0.070019641,0.552328844,5/22/25 8:37

Instant Family,Adoption,Just saw Instant Family - struggling to understand Lizzys psychology,"So there are a few things going on here. Lizzie had been parenting Juan and Lita their whole lives. She was their de facto 'Mom"". Now the Wagners are parenting the kids, and she's expected to be a kid herself. She was probably 'Like what? Excuse me?"". Its hard to step back from that parenting role when you've been doing it for years. It is hard to be a 'kid' when you've had to be the adult since you were 8. Change is hard for anyone, let alone a 15 year old.

Next, she was probably a little jaded. Its a fact that many people go into becoming foster parents with the hope of adopting an infant/toddler, or at least a child under 5. 'No one"" wants the teenagers. Or sometimes foster parents will take older kids as part of a sibling set to get the young kids they really want. That's why all the teens were together at the matching event, with no one paying them any attention. Lizzie is smart, she knows what is up.

If you have been on this sub a while, you'll see many people say they would have rather been raised by biological family than adoptive family, even if that meant being raised in poverty. A fair number of people feel that way. (I was adopted at birth, and I do not feel that way, but it is frequently expressed here)

The letter Lizzie wrote was because she desperately wanted to go 'home' and live with her Mom, no matter how bad it would be. Its not because she didn't care about the Wagners, and she did apologize for it later. She just really REALLY wanted to go 'home'. Which is why she was filling out all of the paperwork for her Mom and pursuing it, even when Mom wasn't really on board.

This movie, while very 'cliche', with lots of foster care stereotypes, was still a solid watch. Hope this helps some :)

In other cases, there's more informal situations where potential foster parents meet kids.

When I was about 13 and it was pretty clear I wouldn't be able to return to my mom (or that my mom would ever be able to live independently again without some sort of miracle), my worker took me to a park and there happened to be a family there from the other side of the state who had two adopted children from foster care that we just happened to meet while we were there.

And the father said he was in front of them, but the victim's wounds were to the back of his head? 

And a brick in the bedroom?! With the children conveniently providing an alibi for why the brick was IN the bedroom? She'll paint it in the bedroom? 

The single nick on the wife's neck? If you strangled someone with murderous intent, that should've shown at least 2 or more deep nail bruises. And no defensive wounds on her? If he laid his hand on her and was violent that it warranted for a bat on the head, where were her defensive wounds? Bruises, at least? 

The grandmother's actions when she heard a commotion  was to go back to sleep? Not protect her children? Who in their right mind goes back to sleep when there's commotion in the house?

The children sounded like they were coached what to say during the interview with the shrink. CPS allowing them to stay in the #1 suspect's custody even when the guardians named in the father's will were present and ready to take them in?

The husband being secretly recorded? And the shared clips shared were only when he explodes in anger, is irate? And shared as evidence only during the second trial?

Inside Man: Most Wanted,movies,Inside man : most wanted,"
>I just saw this movie, and I don't get it : is the ending anti climactic, or did I miss something? 

Not sure what you mean. All you need to know is that the bank robber girl was forced by the German Nazi bad guys to rob the bank because they had her brother. 

Instead she double crossed then (Nazi guys) and had the female fbi agent arrest them. 


>What's up with the mid credit scene? Revenge on the people who killed his brother?

Yup 

>What about the movie title? Does most wanted mean anything special, to the first movie perhaps?

It was the female bank robber lead code name. Other than that, not sure why the title 

>I absolutely loved the movie Inside man, but this one, damn it felt unfinished.

Not surprised. This felt like the Descent Part 2. Just a movie to wrap up the holes  and a lazy copy from the original as well.  That's what disappointed me the most about this one. It copied the negotiation and robbery from the first one. It made the twist at the end lacking. 

The movie was also boring. 

Agree with your Will Smith comparison because he was kind of cocky like his character from bad boys.

Inside Man: Most Wanted,Advice,"My husband, 60s, found out that there is a woman who apparently could very well be his daughter. How do he and I best proceed prudently from here?","I found my 70 year old formerly childless uncle a 37 year old daughter he never knew existed! He and his wife never had children either. His daughter was also the result of a one night deal, and the woman never told him she was pregnant. But crazy enough, she gave the child up for adoption to a couple that lived in our families NYC neighborhood!! Multiple people of my generation in my family have known this girl for years, she was a few years younger than all of us so we didn‚Äôt run in the same circle of friends, she was more friends of the younger siblings of all our friends. But we‚Äôd certainly attended all the same neighborhood parties, social events and frequented the same bars forever. My uncle & her biological father lived in an apartment above the popular neighborhood pizza place for years, but she never knew the man she‚Äôd been searching for her whole life was 12 feet above her every time she went for pizza. They must‚Äôve have passed each on the street thousands of times without ever knowing they were father and daughter. It‚Äôs such a crazy thing. 

Now none of us can believe we never saw the resemblance between them, standing together the father/daughter relationship is unmistakable. It was uncanny really. I mean we also had no reason to be looking for a resemblance, none of us knew her well enough to know she was adopted and we weren‚Äôt on the hunt studying faces looking for kids who just might be my uncle‚Äôs ü§£

It was ancestry DNA that she matched with me as a first cousin, shocking to see a familiar name and not understand immediately why I‚Äôm seeing it HERE ü§£. After deductive reasoning & being terrified about how this might go over, I had no idea if my uncle willing gave a child up for adoption, I didn‚Äôt think he would but who am I to say? So I had no idea how this was going to be received. But I held my breath and delivered the news to my uncle that he was officially a dad at 70! He was beside himself, shocked to say the least and made me explain everything as to how I was able to come to this conclusion üòÇ He and his wife immediately told me to give her their phone number because she deserved to know her father and they both wanted to meet his daughter. The hard part was that he‚Äôd moved down to Florida in their retirement from our old neighborhood, so their first meeting had to be put off until travel arrangements could be made. In that time he lso took an ancestry test and it was officially confirmed by DNA ‚ô•Ô∏è 

She flew down there after a couple months of getting to know each other over the phone and they hit it off, like any father and daughter. They had a beautiful relationship, including her adoptive parents being an integral part of their new little blended family. He thanked them profusely for raising her into such an intelligent, beautiful woman, called them his angels on this earth and sent her mom 2 dozen white roses after the first time they‚Äôd spoken. He wanted to let her family know he wasn‚Äôt trying to take anyone‚Äôs place, he just wanted to be added to the mosaic of his daughter‚Äôs life, as he put it. And on their first Christmas together he gave her 37 gifts, one for each year he missed ‚ô•Ô∏è

My uncle passed away coming up on 3 years ago, they only had 5 years together on this earth. But it was the best 5 years of my uncles life. Now, she continues a mother/daughter relationship with my Aunt, the bonus mom she gained in all of this. ‚ô•Ô∏è",115,0.077592617,0.444039152,5/30/25 15:29

Enjoyed the F-bomb, but now I understand why they bleeped *""What the fuck?""* later. The MPAA wouldn't give two fucks. It makes no sense within the context of the scene why it would be bleeped, but maybe they'll release it ""uncut"" on home video.

My mind is going 1000 miles a minute right now (plus I have a sugar rush from that ""Say It Three Times Slam""), so I will attempt to wrangle all my thoughts in one place. I ended up seeing it twice in a row tonight; first at the 7pm early screening, and then they added a second showing at 9:45pm. I will mention the feedback from the audience at both screenings was kind of muted; not a lot of big laughs or applause breaks. And that's maybe my criticism of it; it's not as fun as I hoped. But you know what? I've been waiting 35 years for this movie, and it still delivered! I appreciated all the little details a lot more the second time around.

While I liked it, I'm still disappointed. 75% of the movie was spoiled for me based on marketing materials alone (my fault for watching every piece of content released, I know). Also, it went by *way* too fast. The movie feels really short, and as such, not every character gets their time to shine. I wonder what they ended up cutting out?

As far as my expectations going into it, I was a bit disappointed that we never found out what happened at the end of the first film, after Beetlejuice got his head shrunk and was waiting for his number to be called. Or how he recruited all those shrunken head servants to do his bidding. We also don't get any mention of Juno (the case worker, and BJ's former boss) or any of the other actors who have since passed (Otho, Maxie Dean). As for the Maitlands, this is the extent of how their absence is handled (an exact quote):

Lydia: ""They found a loophole and moved on.""

Astrid: ""How convenient.""

I will say that I thought Jenna Ortega was perfectly cast in this movie. She very much felt like the heir apparent of Lydia Deetz. I wasn't really a fan of her characterization of Wednesday Addams, but she's a stand-out here.

One other character I absolutely adored was Delores (though I wish she had more to do). The scene where she staples herself together (to Bee Gee's ""Tragedy"") is such an incredible sequence. Reminds me of Sally stitching herself together, but evil. I also loved the ""soul sucking"" effect that was used quite often (R.I.P. Bob).

I'm surprised how much ""screen time"" Charles got, despite not really being in the movie. My god, his scenes were gory! (Even the stop-motion is macabre.) I think the scariest thing about the afterlife is the fact that you stay exactly the way as you are when you die for all eternity. That is fucking frightening.

They killed off Delia! I definitely didn't see that one coming. That really sucks, since it basically came down to some con artists ripping her off by selling non-defanged asps. I'm glad she and Charles are reunited in the afterlife (even though he's only half a person), but it was still way more death than I was expecting.

That's one other thing I want to mention: People don't react realistically in this movie when it comes to death. When Delia breaks it to Lydia early on that Charles is dead, neither of them react like a normal human being. Weirdly, it's mostly played for laughs, but it rubbed me the wrong way. Similarly, when Astrid finally enters the Netherworld (after not believing in the supernatural the entire time), she doesn't seem all that surprised at everything she sees. I know it's a comedy, so I'll give it a pass.

The way the movie convinced Lydia to finally bring back Beetlejuice made sense. It wasn‚Äôt Astrid dying or falling into a coma, as we previously theorized. Instead, they used the exact same plot point as Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, where >!Phoebe falls in love with a ghost (Melody), who ends up having malevolent intentions.!< I'm sure it was just a coincidence, but really weird that two of my all-time favorite childhood movies had revivals this year with the same twist.

Beetlebaby! (*""He's a leg man like his old man.""*) The first part of the movie starts out kind of slow, but it really kicks into high gear when Rory invokes Beetlejuice and they enter his ""therapist's office."" The fact that he impregnated Lydia instantly and she exploded afterbirth is risqu√©, but I like that they're willing to go there. That whole sequence was batshit crazy, but in a good way. Wish there were more moments like that throughout.

It goes without saying, but Michael Keaton is as brilliant as he was in the original. Every time Beetlejuice is on the screen, he shines. Even when the movie made weird choices, like that whole Italian black-and-white flashback sequence. I still don't think it was necessary to show human BJ being a lowly grave robber, or suggestively hacking up his wife into pieces, but I admire it's ability to go into darker territory.

We have to talk about the music. The original film featured four Harry Belafonte songs on the soundtrack. This one leans heavily into pop and disco hits of the past 60 years, and somehow it works a lot better than I expected. The choice to use ""MacArthur Park"" (both the Donna Summer and Richard Harris versions) as this movie's ""Day-O"" sing-along sequence is probably one of the more bizarre experiences I've had in a movie theater, but again, I liked the audacity of such a bold choice. I cried throughout the entire wedding song possession, because it was so beautiful and oddly moving, but the possession scene itself didn‚Äôt have as much oomph as the original. Also, while I dug all the song choices, they really did overshadow all of Elfman's score.

As for the ending, I did not care for the same convenient sandworm deus ex machina as the first movie (and the musical). Also, the Lydia dream-within-a-dream sequence (scored to Pino Donaggio's [Carrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZROwASgBt8) end theme)‚Äîwhere Astrid gets married and gives birth to Beetlebaby, then later Lydia wakes up next to The Juice‚Äîwas not a satisfying ending *at all*, unless they are planning to make another sequel (please?). The first movie ended perfectly for all the characters as far as I'm concerned, but the fact that Lydia is still being haunted by Beetlejuice at the end means her situation hasn't changed at all since the beginning of the film.

My thoughts keep going back and forth. I really enjoyed it as a legacy sequel, but it doesn‚Äôt end up feeling like a classic like the original was. And that's okay, I guess. There was no way it was going to live up to 36 years of hype. I'm still glad we got to see the gang get back together again, if for no other reason than nostalgia. I'm sure it will grow on me through subsequent viewings and years. Thanks for reading all my muddled recollections of the film.

One last thing, I took a quick snap of all the songs in the movie in case someone is interested in tracking down a song. The various artists soundtrack (with end credits suite by Elfman) will be released digitally this Friday.

I think it's a solid movie, the only thing that turned me off is Eastwood's character, who is supposed to be the 'hero' being a rapist.","The rape scene drives home the inaction of the town to do anything when they see something bad happening.  There's a link between Mordecai (the midget) watching the rape, and then later in the movie there is a flashback to him watching the murder of the original town marshall.  He watches both of these terrible things happen almost as a voyeur, knowing what he is seeing is wrong but unwilling to do or say anything about it.  It's the worst case of Bystander Effect.

The movie itself, as others have pointed out, has Eastwood essentially playing The Devil (I've always thought he was the reincarnated Marshall, back for revenge on the town that betrayed him); the town literally makes a deal with the devil to save itself.  They give him the run of the town as long as he agrees to help them defeat, kill or scare off the soon-to-be-returning bad guys that killed the town marshall. Don't forget, the men were hired BY THE TOWN to kill the marshall because the marshall found out that the gold the townspeople had found was on government land so wasn't rightfully theirs.  The marshall was going to report this, so the townspeople had him killed, and then turned in the killers.  That's why the killers were coming back to town: to exact revenge on the town for double-crossing them.

The movie is alot more complex that ""White Hat vs Black Hat""; gone are the days where the main character is the ""good guy"".  It's a look at the European expansion into the west, the greed exhibited, and the lack of oversight or responsibility.  When viewed in this light, the rape of the girl can be seen as analogous to our rape of the land as we expanded through the country.",44,-0.110227273,0.404545455,1/30/24 10:45

High Plains Drifter,Westerns,High Plains Drifter,"I can't explain the comments in that other thread.

The woman had the original marshall in the town whipped to death. She betrayed him as completely as it is possible to betray someone. The whole town, with the exception of Mordecai and possibly the wife of the innkeeper, hired men to kill the marshall. They then turned on the killers, and got them put away in a territorial prison.

The stranger is the ghost or avatar of the dead marshall, returned to burn down the town.

Modern movies are full of John Wick villains who do things so terrible that their eventual killing is justified - really flat-out evil, non-nuanced characters. This movie has a whole town of such villains. We even see the woman later make nice to the returned killers, whom she had also betrayed. Without commenting on the rape scene - it's easy to see why many people think it is problematic - there is no doubt that she is evil.

I don't know how so many people can watch High Plains Drifter and miss all the clues, such as the final scene, where Mordecai is carving Marshall Jim Duncan's headstone: ""I never did know your name,"" to which the departing drifter responds, ""Yes, you do.""",6,0.026574074,0.622384259,5/15/25 23:32

Twilight,twilight,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,"You have a good point:

>Their bond, the way they protect and love each other unconditionally, and the sacrifices they make as a family

Even though most of think its a bad idea, they still back Edward. Esme's whole line in Twlight ""She's with Edward now"". Yeah. That really hit me when watching. Like even though Rosalie didn't like it, she did it anyway and trusted Esme and Carlise.

The first movie just hits right, even the cringe parts. Then after that, its not a hate watch because the movies have a good premise, but its not all the enjoyable anymore. The middle, watching them, is very meh. I do it. I own all of them and I have no regrets buying blu-ray and on Primes. Both Christmas gifts too. I have at least an annual rewatch during the summer. Normally two. But its mainly to just do a proper complete marathon for the sake of a marathon. Just to make it to Breaking Dawn properly without skipping the middle because it doesn't feel right. I also like the ending of New Moon.

But I think as a romance reader and mainly a paranormal romance reader (thank you Twilight and Stephanie Meyer for sending my spiraling), it hits just right. All the right points for a happily ever after.

Where the Crawdads Sing,movies,Official Discussion - Where the Crawdads Sing [SPOILERS],"I was curious how they were going to pull this off since such a large majority of the book takes place in Kya‚Äôs head (she hardly talks to anyone - even the lawyer). 

I wish they would have spent more time on her childhood since the scenes of her surviving on her own in the book have such a desperate feeling (counting out pennies, rationing food), but I get why they sped through since there is so much material. 

Overall though, it was a good adaptation. I loved how they gave more details to her and Jumpin/Mabel‚Äôs relationship (she doesn‚Äôt even attend the funeral in the book), and really fleshed out the idea that family is more than blood - it‚Äôs the people who are there for you and support you. 

The one thing that bugged me both in the book and the movie - wouldn‚Äôt that swamp be filled with gators???? You see one quick shot of them in the opening scenes but no mention at all in the book. They do all kinds of swamp activities‚Ä¶and I kept waiting for someone to explain why no one is worried about getting attacked.

Where the Crawdads Sing,books,Finished 'Where the Crawdads Sing' and some of my thoughts about the plot twist,"Kya never let the wood pile get low. Even in summers. It‚Äôs mentioned she always kept up on this ‚Äúchore‚Äù of hers.

I actually don‚Äôt think it was a huge plot twist now looking back. The mention of the way the female fireflies trick the males pulls the murder in perfectly. And then of course her poem she had hidden away. It was also stated she wasn‚Äôt sure how she could continue on in fear that Chase would come back for her- that seemed strong foreshadowing in my opinion that she had something to do with it. Not to mention why would she ever leave her comfort zone to meet a stranger (her publisher) in a strange place. None of it added up.

Although it feels uncharacteristic of her to commit murder, express emotion (shock) at news of the murder, etc there was a lot the reader didn‚Äôt know fully about Kya. For example, when Tate made the decision not to see her anymore as he watched her hiding from someone passing by on a boat. That brought in a new perspective I hadn‚Äôt thought of. I never before looked at her as ‚Äúthe crazy marsh girl‚Äù everyone made her out to be. She always had just seemed like a frightened girl protecting herself and not knowing a lot about life.. but this case and others show there was a more intense wild to Kya that the reader wouldn‚Äôt necessarily see.

Lastly, we know very well that Jodie taught Kya all about how to hide and get rid of tracks. That made it very obvious to me it was one of the two of them. She read book after book on science and biology, it isn‚Äôt out of line to assume some of those discussed fingerprints, crime, etc. Yes the plan and cover up of killing Chase may seem elaborate, but we are not giving enough credit to the girl her survived on her own since age 6.",33,0.163175231,0.536671058,3/3/21 22:32
Where the Crawdads Sing,books,Finished 'Where the Crawdads Sing' and some of my thoughts about the plot twist,"Just finished the book today and honestly I found the flash forward to the murder really annoying in the beginning. I would‚Äôve been totally fine with just reading a book about Kya in the marsh, her overcoming her mistrust of other people and healing from the trauma of everybody abandoning her. There was enough of a story there without the murder mystery.

That being said, I had a feeling all along that Kya did it, especially since she was so easy going in jail and never stated that she was innocent. 

While I find no explanation how she came up with such an elaborate plan (assuming she wouldn‚Äôt know too much about how police investigates murder, having grown up outside of society) I feel the violent things Chase did to her triggered something. Having seen her mum get abused by her father, knowing that she might never be safe in her own marsh again, not knowing where to turn to for help, I can see how killing him might have been the only solution in her mind.

Britain and The Blitz,whowouldwin,A single F-35 that doesn't need maintenance and has an infinite ammo/fuel supply must defend Britain during the Blitz,"Can the F35 attack incoming bombers while they are over mainland Europe, en route to the UK? 

In theory, a beast mode F35 can carry 16 missiles, 14 of which would be AIM-120Ds, with a range of around 100mi. There is no real way a German aircraft would have a chance in hell of dodging these with no RWR or much of a clue to their abilities.

Given the sortie time of the F35, depending on reload speed, it could likely launch three attacks on a German formation each night as they approach. 42 bombers destroyed by basically magic every night means 47 days to reach the total number of aircraft destroyed.

I think the psychological effect would cause an end much sooner. Imagine youre heading out that first night in Sept. Suddenly 14 bombers in your formation just explode while still in German airspace. Then it happens twice more.",63,0.119230769,0.375641026,4/20/25 16:38

Step 3: connect F35 to local Radar infrastructure (for coverage)
Step 4: attach a pulley or elevator system to the tower to haul missiles up.
Step 5: launch an infinite amount of missiles at the Luftwaffe until they cry themselves back to Berlin.¬†

There are probably more elegant ways of doing this, but the concept is simple enough: raise F35 up, shoot over the horizon missiles, reload. If possible, extend its range even further with on land radar. This means it‚Äôs functionally less of a plane and more the worlds angriest SAM Battery.",164,0.133333333,0.442380952,4/20/25 16:46
Britain and The Blitz,whowouldwin,A single F-35 that doesn't need maintenance and has an infinite ammo/fuel supply must defend Britain during the Blitz,"Let's stop doing this by broad strokes and look at it day by day. For this analysis, I'm going to assume the F-35 can hold 16 Air-to-Air missiles, those have a 100% kill rate, and due to its much faster flight time can manage two sorties for each German assault.

The timeline I'm using is [this one](https://battleofbritain1940.com/).

* Day 1: [10 July 1940](https://battleofbritain1940.com/entry/wednesday-10-july-1940/) - 26 incoming bombers. All are shot down before reaching Britain.
* Day 2: [11 July](https://battleofbritain1940.com/entry/thursday-11-july-1940/) - Three attacks separated by 4 and 6 hours respectively. The first two waves each had 10 bombers, the last had 12. All are shot down.
* Day 3: [12 July](https://battleofbritain1940.com/entry/friday-12-july-1940/) - Two attacks separated by 4 hours. The first had at least 5 bombers (as that number were shot down). Let's assume that it was less than 32, and that it was shot down. For the second raid, [this source](https://aberdeenvoice.com/2013/07/the-july-1940-blitz-in-aberdeen-part-2/) says 6 total bombers, so they go down as well.
* Day 4: [13 July](https://battleofbritain1940.com/entry/saturday-13-july-1940/) - Two attacks separated by 2.5 hours. The second raid had 12 bombers, so they'd be easily wiped out. I can't find numbers for how many were in the first raid.

I'm going to stop here because there is a pattern emerging. Generally speaking, most raids were far enough apart that rearming would be trivial. Moreover, most raids were also small enough that a single sortie would result in 100% casualties of the bombers in the attack--even without the two sorties per raid stipulation.

Maybe that would have resulted in larger massed raids (like were seen later in the Battle of Britain), but I think it is just as likely that after a week or two of 100% bomber losses (plus probably a few fighters shot down just because) and nothing to show for it, the whole thing might have stopped before it got anywhere.",65,-0.044887057,0.421840659,4/20/25 21:05

This applies for every other sport too, Messi, Ronaldo in fact were crucial for the popularity of leagues of US(MLS), and Saudi. Virat Kohli is the face of Cricket for 2028 Olympics and so on.

FIDE needs the superstars and likewise vice versa. For sustaining Chess itself in the future, both parties need to work on a mutual level and find sustainable situations.

- most people don't usually need to work while looking after kids. It's so much more distracting to work while having kids- if you ignore the kids and work, kids will go mad, if you ignore work, your boss will go mad- more anxiety for parents

- financial issues affecting everyone- more anxiety

- Kids arent themselves during this. I bet at least 90% of children have had massive behavioural / anxiety changes that they've never had before. And parents can't go out to get advice, therapists etc., parents can't have other people help them with childcare, even for an hour.

You are making too many sweeping statements about children, statements that don't account for children being individuals and having emotions. I'm guessing you don't have kids otherwise you'd realise that most pre-corona children are COMPLETELY different to the children now. As are parents. Even in childless relationships, I can guarantee there will be more divorces and pregnancies after this quarantine- it's affecting couples who have known each other years, influencing major life decisions, because it's forcing everyone together.",375,0.071452381,0.53952381,5/12/20 17:19

The Life List,netflix,Thoughts on 'The Life List',"I liked the movie, I do agree they could have shown the Alex and Brad relationship a bit better. He also wasn‚Äôt her attorney, he was the executor of her mom‚Äôs estate. I think, it was essentially a dislike, to friends to lovers relationship and it was built over a year while Alex was doing the list. I was a bit üëÄ when they did sleep together, I was was like nooo he‚Äôs cheating, Alex doesn‚Äôt care and this is wrong üòë 

But he cleared it up -  I think essentially even though Nina was a great person and possibly a great girlfriend, it seems like they just fell out of love and Nina knew it after seeing them together. 

My hot take was that the Mom was actually a terrible Mom. I mean she clearly had a favorite. She sidelined her sons and didn‚Äôt even bother to leave any kind of message for her sons??? Like WTF??? On top of that she was a cheater and Alex literally blanked out how good a dad her dad was to her. Even when she found out that she was a product of an affair, there was no sympathy for the Dad. She kept sidelining him and he was the one who constantly reached out to mend their relationship when it didn‚Äôt seem like he really did anything wrong. 

In real life, I don‚Äôt think I would be able to stand Alex or her Mom.",3,0.178977273,0.644507576,4/8/25 19:18

The Life List,netflix,Thoughts on 'The Life List',"I liked the movie, it was a nice watch.. What I took more from it was all the moments she was self-discoverying, then the sweet moment with her mom... I though the romance was too fast, they didnt really have that many scenes and then they love eachother... The cheating obviously wasnt good, I dont agree with cheating at all but im not an hyprocrate to judge... people cheat, it actually happens in real life, isnt te point of movie or at least some to show real life situations? in my POV theres still this stigma that characters in movies, shows should be perfect... people are very judgmental when it comes to movies but its a reflecting to the actual world. Peopl cheat, people are selfish sometimes without even noticinig not in a way intentionally to hurt others, sometimes ppl pushes family away, some people feel like they are left out for no reason, sometimes people do great things for someone they dont even kno, or risk their life for a stranger... 

ppl judge to much. Id be a hypocrite if I judged Alex character for people ""self-centered"".. BUT all and all it was ok watch.... chemistry was good BUT NOTHING COMPARES her chemistry with Nicholas in Purple Hearts theeeeyyyyy nailed that movie even with a shaky plot.",2,0.284027778,0.5,4/9/25 3:38

The Life List,netflix,Thoughts on 'The Life List',"Everyone talks about how the characters suck, but the structure of this movie is also terrible. It tries to do way too much, and be way too many things. One minute it's a goofy comedy, the next it's a 'how do I reach these kids??' story, then a weird love triangle, all the while this family stuff is going on. As a result, we have over 2 hours to put up with these characters and weird dialogue.

We don't learn anything about the protagonist  for ourselves, it's the mother just saying 'Alex, you're stuck in life' What character development do we really see by the end? 

The whole thing with her biological father was frustrating. It was built up for most of the movie then he's just.... gone? And no explanation that I could get.

The first scene with the baby shower doesn't match the vibe of thr rest of the film, and could definitely be cut. I get that it's meant to introduce the characters, but there are so many here that you just lose track

There's a ticking clock with the whole 'find true love by the end of the year' thing but it turns out that was fake and it didn't even matter. Such a cop out and makes the audience feel betrayed

This wasn't a terrible concept but it would work way better as a TV series, and a more self-aware protagonist, with actual stakes.",2,0.056,0.571333333,4/25/25 16:52

According to many accounts, Chris Kyle was an asshole, a bigot and a racist who actively enjoyed killing foreign people just because they weren't like him.

I found this article of high quality but to answer your question of controversy, Id say about 3/4ths of the way through this article it'll discuss some of the controversy that surrounds Chris Kyle. 

As far as the movie goes I know a lot of people didn't feel as though this movie was deserving of an Oscar, and felt there were more movies that would be more deserving of one. I enjoyed American Sniper but it didn't feel like a 10/10 best movie ever to me. ",80,0.44,0.571111111,2/24/15 3:20
American Sniper,OutOfTheLoop,What's the controversy surrounding American Sniper?,"The controversy to me isn't that its a war propaganda piece, I haven't seen the movie so I can't comment on that. However I can tell you why I won't be seeing the movie. It doesn't even mention one time the outrageous lies he's told over the years. Some of which are:

- He punched Jesse Ventura out over comments he made about how the seals deserved to lose a few, because he disagreed with the war and didn't like Bush. No one saw this happen and Ventura sued Kyle for defamation, which Ventura won. I'd also like to point out to people that rage over Ventura continuing the suit after Kyle's death that Ventura offered to drop the suit if Kyle had recanted the story before he died, he did not. Stinks of a bullshit story.

- He told a story of shooting dead two carjackers in Texas, which no law enforcement ever heard about and no reported deaths from the medical examiners office. Obvious lie.

- He told a story of being on top of the superdome during Hurricane Katrina with another SEAL buddy and between the two of them they sniped around 30 looters. Which is the worst lie you can tell because not only is it obviously so absurd, but someone who would murder people for looting is not someone who I would make out to be a hero of any kind. For all of the people who disagree that Kyle enjoyed killing, what kind of person would kill 30 people for looting? A crime that last time I checked did not warrant the death penalty. 

Chris Kyle may have been many things, but pretty much everything the guy claimed is suspect at this point. He's the adult equivalent of that kid you knew in school whos dad worked at Nintendo so he had the newest Mortal Kombat game a year before it came out.

American Sniper,movies,Did people even watch American Sniper?,"I see a lot of comments regarding the psyche and actions of Chris Kyle, leading to a lot of condemning, but I also see a lack of experience when it comes to this war.  It's nothing against any of you redditors, but as a combat veteran, I thought I could provide some insight on it.  Just for the record, I'm not a huge fan of his.  He was a very talented SEAL, and that's about where it ends with me.

In regards to labeling him as a ""psychotic killer"" because in the book he states he felt nothing after killing an individual, and loving it; How can any of you be surprised at these statements?  He was a trained sniper, having worked for months to achieve that status.  He did his job and he was very good at it.  I was a Combat Medic.  I loved my job, and whenever I did it, I was a happy man.  I knew tankers who loved their job, especially whenever they fired off that main gun round.  Can you blame the guys?  They're doing the job they were trained to do.  In a war where you find yourself twiddling your thumbs for the majority of the day, you get pretty bored, so doing actual fighting is very exciting.  

Yes, he was also a liar.  I personally don't lie about my service because there is nothing to lie about.  I'm proud of what I did, so why tarnish it?  Chris Kyle was a legend in the Navy.  Hearing someone has a bounty on your head is pretty gnarly, and you don't get to that point by sitting at a desk all day.  So when he left the service and started his life as a civilian, I assume he felt the need to live up to his status as a legend.  He invented those tales to captivate his fan base and keep them reeled it.  He wanted to stay relevant.  He didn't want to seem like he had gone soft after he got out of the Navy.  I can get that.  Transitioning is difficult, especially when you've proven yourself to be one hell of a warfighter.  I know this because mine was.  Now, this doesn't make his lies justified, just understandable.

Finally, how can anyone be surprised this man held animosity towards the people that he fought on a daily basis?  We all saw some brutal acts over there, so it is hard not to be a little jaded.  As a sniper, you have to be able to dehumanize your enemy, or else your reliability to engage targets comes into question.  The EOTech attached to my M4 has no magnification power, so all I ever saw were silhouettes and vague shapes.  I always saw my targets not as people, but instead as lethal movement.  Chris's scope had the ability to see faces and reactions with great clarity.  As a sniper, you get a detailed look at the damage each one of your bullets cause.  I won't lie to you, John Rambo had it right; *""When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing.""*  Some of us just do not have a very hard time coping with what we experienced.  For some veterans, it was very easy pulling that trigger, especially when you see your enemy as inferior.  Now, I don't agree that all this applies to the Iraqi people as a whole, but I also had the good fortune of meeting some very friendly and caring locals.  But, Chris Kyle wasn't sent to Iraq to win hearts and minds.  Snipers kill and Chris did that part very well.

Once again, I'm not a Chris Kyle fan boy.  I didn't pay to see the movie, and I didn't pay to read his book.  I just think there's a lot of uninformed opinions flying around everywhere.  I figured a little insight wouldn't hurt.",301,0.171805449,0.700063025,1/20/15 8:02
American Sniper,movies,Did people even watch American Sniper?,"I watched the movie and enjoyed it.  However, what has me upset is that they are glorifying a guy who many not be all he claimed to be because he has quite the history of lying, which I found out afterward when I wanted to find out more about him.  Sorry, but if you are a historical figure, I'm going to Google you!

Finding out that he was such a liar calls into question, for me, all his so-called accomplishments.  I get that those sent off to war have to have the ability to to dehumanize the enemy somewhat but his claim that he had went into New Orleans during Katrina to pick off looters is really troubling and paints him to be a murderous sociopath.  In New Orleans, we're talking about fellow Americans.  If he felt that his role was judge, jury and executioner on American soil, do you really think that he was above picking off unarmed Iraqis??  I sure as hell don't and it is troubling to me that he is being portrayed as hero!

American Sniper,movies,Did people even watch American Sniper?,"As a non American I didn't feel it was a ""Merica, Fuck Yeah"" sort of movie. There was the patriotism that seems to be very important in American society so I didn't feel that was unjust or glorifying anything.

What I got from the movie was not that it glorified killing, not that ""all Muslims are bad, m'kay?"" but the gradual disintegration of a psyche subjected to enormous stress. He struck me as someone who had a bit of a ""black and white"" view of the world and that made it difficult for him to cope and justify what he was asked to do. There was also this part of him that wanted to protect those that needed to be protected so he was often pushing himself into situations where he thought he needed to be to help protect his fellow soldiers.

So, having said all that I felt the movie itself was a little lacking. It didn't have the emotional punch of Million Dollar Baby or the character exposition of Unforgiven. I don't think it's Eastwood's best movie by a long shot. It's not awful but with Eastwood as the Director I guess I expected a little more from it.",65,0.013431373,0.520588235,1/20/15 4:15
American Sniper,movies,American Sniper- One of the most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time,"I would very much argue that the film is coming from the same point of view that you are. I didn't really like the film all that much (apart from Cooper's performance), but I'm kind of shocked that the film has received complaints of jingoism and pro-war from a film that is pretty staunchly anti-war and of the mentality that killing is an awful thing to do, and that there's a problem when we praise people who do it.

This is, after all, a film that starts off with Kyle's father telling them that they need to protect the sheep from the wolves as he pulls out his belt to beat them in the same breath. Throughout the film, the mentality that Kyle has been instilled with is challenged as he's forced to either kill people he'd rather not kill, or his many decisions based around killing people get otherwise innocents killed. Kyle's mentality of war is contrasted with brief shots of the Iraqi sniper who also seemingly has a family of his own that he himself is trying to protect (leftovers no doubt from when Spielberg was still assigned to this project and wanted the film to focus on both snipers equally), which makes one question the extent of radicalism not on the Iraqi side, but Kyle's as well, especially given that it shows how heavily religious he is.

As for the final credits scene of the parade, I'd argue very much that the film sees this as a tragedy. Regardless of who Chris Kyle the actual person was (and I believe that shouldn't matter in the case of this film), Chris Kyle the film character has several scenes where he's approached by people when he's back and there's a clear sense of discomfort with all the praise. Even when he says to the therapist that he's willing to answer for every shot he took, he says it with a lot of hesitation, as if he might break down and cry any second. If the film views Kyle as a hero at any point, it's when he starts to help other veterans deal with the stresses of coming back from war, but of course when he dies and has a funeral, this isn't what's celebrated.",39,0.027981481,0.409462963,11/11/15 19:50

American Sniper,movies,American Sniper- One of the most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time,"I'm not American so I didn't know who this Chris Kyle guy was or how much he is praised or worshipped, but to me this movie felt very anti-war. From the start of the movie you see Chris is ingrained with an almost tyrannical morality by his dad. And this ""belief/moral"" is the drive that makes him enlist in the first place. Then what we see is the slow fall of a man who thinks he's fighting for what he thinks is right, as he is confronted against the horrors of war, something no normal human should ever be ""OK"" with.

This is especially brought in focus by 3 separate scenes: SPOILERS!!!

Firstly his friend's funeral, where he believed his friend died because of he thought lesser of their ""crusade"". Secondly it was when he meets his brother, who was rightly traumatised by the war, Chris could not comprehend his brother's emotions. The best scene was when Chris came home at last, and is enjoying a drink at a bar. Normally this scene in action movies is a respite scene, the hero rests after his long struggle, but here, we learn that Chris is so negatively affected by the war, he is actually hiding at the bar, without even telling his family (who were so important to him previously) that his tour is over.

END OF SPOILERS!!

These add up to me, to paint a picture of a man who is both being traumatised, and having his core beliefs challenged, that he is closing up within himself, becoming dispassionate and almost fanatical. For me the real heroics was when he broke out of the slump and started helping the others, but as fate wants to make a point, Chris still succumbs to PTSD, just not his own.",13,0.163786139,0.407908163,11/11/15 20:47

> [Chapter XXVII, ...] it was also in [Julius'] mind, as a part of the general design he had planned against all those lords who had usurped Church lands, to remove Giovanpagolo Baglioni, tyrant of Perugia.

> And coming to Perugia with this intention and resolve, of which all men knew, he would not wait to enter the town with a force sufficient for his protection, but entered it unattended by troops, although Giovanpagolo was there with a great company of soldiers whom he had assembled for his defence. And thus, urged on by that impetuosity which stamped all his actions, accompanied only by his body-guard, he committed himself into the hands of his enemy, whom he forthwith carried away with him, leaving a governor behind to hold the town for the Church. 

> All prudent men who were with the Pope remarked on his temerity, and on the pusillanimity of Giovanpagolo; nor could they conjecture why the latter had not, to his eternal glory, availed himself of this opportunity for crushing his enemy, and at the same time enriching himself with plunder, the Pope being attended by the whole College of Cardinals with all their luxurious equipage. For it could not be supposed that he was withheld by any promptings of goodness or scruples of conscience; because in the breast of a profligate living in incest with his sister, and who to obtain the princedom had put his nephews and kinsmen to death, no virtuous impulse could prevail. So that the only inference to be drawn was, that men know not how to be splendidly wicked or wholly good, and shrink in consequence from such crimes as are stamped with an inherent greatness or disclose a nobility of nature.",141,0.278888889,0.605,6/20/25 4:20

The Two Popes,OldSchoolCool,"[1992] Two weeks after tearing up a photo of the Pope on Saturday Night Live, Sinead O'Connor was nearly booed off the stage at a Bob Dylan tribute concert. She developed a lifelong friendship with Kris Kristofferson thanks to the words of support he gave her in the moment.",">On 3 October 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest. She sang an a cappella version of Bob Marley's ""War"", which she intended as a protest against sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, referring to child abuse rather than racism. She then presented a photo of Pope John Paul II to the camera while singing the word ""evil"", after which she tore the photo into pieces, said ""Fight the real enemy"", and threw the pieces towards the camera. The incident occurred nine years before John Paul II acknowledged the sexual abuse within the Church.

>Saturday Night Live had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan; during the dress rehearsal, she held up a photo of a refugee child. NBC Vice-president of Late Night Rick Ludwin recalled that when he saw O'Connor's action, he ""literally jumped out of [his] chair"". SNL writer Paula Pell recalled personnel in the control booth discussing the cameras cutting away. The audience was completely silent, with no booing or applause; executive producer Lorne Michaels recalled that ""the air went out the studio"". He ordered that the applause sign not be used.

>A nationwide audience saw O'Connor's live performance, which the New York Daily News's cover called a ""Holy Terror"". NBC received more than 500 calls on Sunday and 400 more on Monday, with all but seven criticising O'Connor; the network received 4,400 calls in total. Contrary to rumour, NBC was not fined by the Federal Communications Commission for O'Connor's act, as the FCC has no regulatory power over such behaviour. NBC did not edit the performance out of the West coast tape-delayed broadcast that night.

>During his opening monologue the following week, Catholic-raised host Joe Pesci held up the photo, explaining that he had taped it back together, to huge applause. Pesci also said that if it had been his show, ""I would have gave [sic] her such a smack"".

>In a 2002 interview with Salon, when asked if she would change anything about the SNL appearance, O'Connor replied, ""Hell, no!"" In her 2021 book Rememberings, O'Connor said of the incident: ""Everyone wants a pop star, see? But I am a protest singer. I just had stuff to get off my chest. I had no desire for fame.""

>Two weeks after the Saturday Night Live appearance, she was set to perform ""I Believe in You"" at the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary tribute concert in Madison Square Garden. She was greeted by a thundering mixture of cheers and jeers. During the booing, Kris Kristofferson told her not to ""let the bastards get you down"", to which she replied, ""I'm not down."" The noise eventually became so loud that O'Connor saw no point in starting the scheduled song. She called for the keyboard player to stop and the microphone to be turned up, and then screamed over the audience with an improvised, shouted rendition of ""War"", which she stopped just after mentioning child abuse, emphasizing the point of her previous action. She then looked straight to the audience for a second and left the stage. Kristofferson then comforted her, as she cried.",1263,0.054040404,0.388695781,7/11/23 12:12

Despicable Me 4,movies,Official Discussion - Despicable Me 4 [SPOILERS],"Is it just me, or did this movie feel like they jammed two films together, and trimmed a bunch of scenes and plotlines for time?  

Agnes has trouble lying - this comes up a few times leading to the karate scene, and then is never mentioned again.  

Edith beats up the karate teacher, and then he never reappears and there is no repercussion to what she did or payoff regarding her fighting skill.  

Margo mentions leaving her friends (who we've never seen), is bullied in school (which we also don't see beyond when she gets back into the car), and then it never comes up again  there could have been something with the girl next door, but there doesn't seem to be anything beyond the girl coming over with the honey badger.  

Lucy has that whole hairdressing fiasco. Then she runs away from the woman in the store about halfway through the film... And then that's never brought up again. What happened to that woman?  

The bad guys spent literally the entire film slowly making their way to Gru, only to get there in the last 15 minutes and be instantly defeated. 

And the minions didn't interact with the main cast at all - you could play their Mega Minions parts on their own without the rest of the film and it would make just as much sense.   
They could probably even be removed from the final fight, since the bad guys had already pretty much been defeated at that point, and their plotline had wrapped with them retiring (making it very odd when they came out of retirement immediately after).

The film isn't necessarily bad, exactly. Just completely disjointed.  
It feels like maybe they had a coherent script that followed up on the kids and Lucy's plotlines, but then some producer pointed out that there weren't enough minions.  
So in order to keep the runtime at about 90 minutes, they wrote an unconnected minions superhero short, removed a bunch of scenes focusing on Gru's family from the film, and then gave the minions a one minute cameo crushing the villain at the end to try and tie everything together.

Addendum: Gru's name is Felonious Gru. The baby is called Gru Jr. So is the baby also called Felonious, or is it called Gru Gru?",415,-0.0125,0.473809524,7/4/24 0:17

Despicable Me 4,movies,Official Discussion - Despicable Me 4 [SPOILERS],"It's certainly better than 3 and the first Minions at least. This pretty much has all of the same structural problems of the third - the detachment of Gru and the Minions (and the latter's subplot containing the bulk of the funniest material), too many characters to juggle, and an almost episodic feel. Simpsons logic makes the series consistently appealing to younger audiences, but does rob the chance to grow the series with families like Toy Story did.


With all of this being said, what was here was thankfully decently funny on both the A and B plot. Gru and Gru Jr. (Is that Felonius Jr.) have a fun rapport that reminded me of Jack Jack and Bob, but with an appropriate mean streak to it. The Mega Minions were in the film less than expected but earned some serious laughs when they were on screen (you know if you like these guys or not 6 films in). Poppy was a fun character who almost served as a foil to the girls, and Joey King was clearly having a blast going full Shelly from South Park.


Speaking of having a blast, there is a continuous take here with the Minions in the AVL office space that was stuffed with sight gags and very fun to watch - and followed by the very cute and funny retirement scene. Probably Illumination's best comedic animation work to date.


Will Ferrell was enjoyable if a bit underutilized. A victim of too many characters I suppose, he's definitely the least memorable of the villains of the 4. And having the older villains come back was a fun moment but does him no favours. Ah well, he still has his Oscar chances with ""Training A-Train"".


Also, lord knows the Skibidi Toilet crowd are gonna have a blast with that last song. Not sure if intentional or not, but a shrewd choice nonetheless.


I had a good time with this, as someone who has always enjoyed this series, but I am curious how many trips left to the well they have before diminishing returns. For now though, it's good to see Gru and Co back and who knows, by the time the make another of these I may have a Gru Jr. of my own to take, instead of being the ""guy who grew up with the series and thus is seeing the midnight show of it"" like everyone else in my crowd XD.",96,0.206351852,0.438030864,7/3/24 22:33

(EDIT: November *and* April, not November *to* April. Once the river freezes, it becomes part of the highway, and we just drive across the ice through winter)

I feel for OOP here, there's really nothing she could have done. We had three big dogs up there and thankfully an RCMP officer had spare keys and helped us care for them when emergencies happened once or twice. I myself was a care person for a neighbor's dog since I never left town, had the keys

I'm so glad everything worked out and OOP was able to make it home after a day! Hopefully she'll get a spare key to a trusted neighborhood hermit up there so this doesn't happen again",936,0.097727273,0.359090909,3/19/23 11:39

I despise this kind of action movie that tries to be fun by having the leads be silly doing stupid things. 

Action movies can be fun. That's the point more often than not. But they're fun because there's a genuine sense of drama and peril and the fun comes from the characters' reaction to the circumstances they find themselves in, not from forcibly shoving comedy onto the film regardless of the story and the characters. 

The Jump Street film did a good of this by being comedies chiefly.

Films like Back in Action are shit because they're bad at story, bad at action, bad at comedy and as someone who loves action movies, I long for the day when these films will stop being made",2,0.035416667,0.436458333,1/31/25 10:42

Zazes was tone deaf, lacked status, and had piercings. His rapping was terrible. Plus, he drove a jalopy. Sphe did not feel comfortable around him and did not like his music one bit.

Sizwe had no chemistry with Charlotte and felt no engagement in their conversations. The spark just wasn't there. Like Sphe, he felt extreme discomfort around her. They were not compatible at all.

Why didn't Sizwe and Sphe tell Zazes and Charlotte that they were not attracted to them and that they were not comfortable around them?

Did Bongi not feel the courage to go through with Grace's plans? Is that why she felt betrayed?

Sizwe did tell Sphe that she loved her. He just lacked the courage then.

Bongi and Gracious tried and failed to make lion sounds.

Sphe and Sizwe's breakup caused Gracious and Bongi to feel remorseful and drop their rivalry. They didn't realize that they were made for each other. They were so blinded by their jealousy. Sphe and Sizwe both refused to speak to their mothers during the breakup, and shut them both out.

Perhaps the blind dates got together or went with someone else.

Why didn't Sphe tell Zazes that his rapping was terrible?

Minions,PathOfExileBuilds,3.26 Thoughts on minion builds?,"Chains of command becomes decent starter, as you no longer care if you AG dies early on, bricking all uniques you invested into it.

So you level as whatever minions, srs, absolution, same tree pretty much, and then @ 70 buy 1c chains of command, buy wasp nest, use chance to poison support at start, maybe give any temp chains on hit gloves you can buy for 1alch on the market to AG, windscream, you hit like 3m dps on naked build like this with 0 clusters and abyssal jewels.

Then you upgrade this, get cluster, get jewels, darkness enthroned, maybe move on to better weapon, it isn't difficult to reach dot cap, for just couple of divs.

Build is clunky on bosses, and overall pretty boring, because if you automate the curse and trigger offering on wand, ther's nothing to cast, you just run around.

In terms of power per investment, if we are talking super basic, so let's say 5c on day1 budget as soon as you hit 70 in blood aqueduct, this is difficult to beat.",14,-0.014285714,0.570238095,6/7/25 13:08
Minions,PathOfExileBuilds,3.26 Thoughts on minion builds?,"I have a guardian summoners that crushes through campaign. I think I will transition him to maybe skele archers or something later, because I don‚Äôt have an endgame plan yet (and ghazzy seems to think skeles gonna be strong)

For minion guardian leveling, the tech is simple: melee minion skill (dom blow, smite, cyclone + CwC SrS), holy relic (+feeding frenzy, optionally cull), then main link is zombies. Holy relic regen buff makes your zombies just fine to stay alive through the whole campaign, but if you‚Äôre at all concerned, just add ‚Äú5% life on minion death‚Äù keystone.

You path straight out through minion nodes, get the two clusters (minion life and minion attack speed + convert attack speed), go up to outer ring through the life/ES node, then take the big cluster for minion dmg also applies to you. After that, path towards witch side to get witch nodes and maybe cluster jewel nodes. 

Ascend towards aura relics asap, to convert all that attack and phys dmg into elementals. 

That‚Äôs about it. You can figure out what to do in maps- with 50% res efficiency, I‚Äôm thinking small minions with fast AS will be good, and benefit from all the auras like haste, precision, vit, hatred/anger/wrath from ascend, pride? Idk, just every aura I can fit. Determination from spectres, maybe purity of ele. Everything.

EDIT: forgot to mention: you throw in every minion you can fit, because why not. SRS or skele totem. Golems, whichever you like best. Carrion probably. Spectres- in campaign just grab the necromancers that cast whatever curse. Can plow thru maps with itemized spectre auras.",4,0.264444444,0.394920635,6/7/25 9:10

One of Them Days,blackladies,Unpopular opinion: One of Them Days was kinda disappointing.,"It was just cute. Nothing more and nothing less. And it did well at the box office relative to its budget so I was happy Issa was able to profit and keep its production controlled to pay staff and actors.

One of Them Days,blackladies,Unpopular opinion: One of Them Days was kinda disappointing.,"It was fun and silly. Mid-tier, lower budget movies are kinda important for the film landscape so I don‚Äôt need it to be anything more than it was. SZA‚Äôs character was infuriating but their friendship was adorable. Keke truly is a star. She just shines on the screen. I was rooting so much for her character. And honestly, it‚Äôs perfect for a low-stakes movie night.¬†",188,0.225,0.696875,3/5/25 15:14
One of Them Days,blackladies,Unpopular opinion: One of Them Days was kinda disappointing.,"I saw it with my friend for galentines Day and the entire time me and her was just laughing at how silly the movie was after a while. The acting was okay and I think I just didn‚Äôt like how poorly Sza‚Äôs character was. Whoever wrote her character gave her no redeeming qualities to the point I wasn‚Äôt even happy she was forgiven in the end. I think if this was with some lesser known actoresses then it may not have felt so forced and silly but it just missed the mark. I would have probably liked it more if I was drunk and would laugh at anything üòÇ.

Edit: for reference me and my friend are 23 and 24 so I would say we are the target audience (possibly the vibe fit) and still weren‚Äôt feeling it.",61,0.040625,0.5921875,3/5/25 15:07
One of Them Days,blackladies,Unpopular opinion: One of Them Days was kinda disappointing.,"I‚Äôm with the majority that agreed this movie was a cute lil bop. 

HOWEVER- I supported because we really do deserve more fun movies about US! Even if it‚Äôs silly or the plot isn‚Äôt mind blowing. Many of us became accustomed to every movie needing to be this over the top, $100 million dollar budget blockbuster in the last decade or more. 

We deserve more slice of life movies! We all can relate to the idea of freaking out over rent being due. This movie takes it to the most severe level and I liked the challenges of two young girls trying to make sure they can keep their roof over their head.

I‚Äôm probably an outlier here but I loved Sza‚Äôs character. Gorgeous, floats like a butterfly through her life, even though she makes chaos come around- I think we all know an annoying, pretty woman that just has an undeniable sense of easy breezy in her life.

Keke was the grounded character, she‚Äôs trying to think realistically to get to their solution. She‚Äôs still funny in this role and makes the level of stress important through her acting. We should be able to relate to her simply through her realism. 

For me, their characters are really great from a duo perspective. Keke brings the reality, and Sza‚Äôs character brought the out of the box thinking. They balance each other to a degree by having that tension in my opinion. 

All in all, definitely a feel good movie. Probably will be a staple for my cozy nights in, and I can‚Äôt wait to see more comedies with black ladies in front and center.",41,0.261111111,0.582708033,3/5/25 16:31

The Core,interestingasfuck,"Mi-8 Helicopter crashing over the core of the Chernobyl reactor on October, 1986",It hit the cables. It didn't just melt in the radiation.,4249,0,0,12/29/23 9:50
The Core,interestingasfuck,"Mi-8 Helicopter crashing over the core of the Chernobyl reactor on October, 1986","On October 2, 1986, during the liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, Vladimir Vorobyov's Mi-8 helicopter crashed. The helicopter, which was processing the roof of the station, touched the crane cable with its blades and crashed to the ground. Crew members Alexander Jungkind, Leonid Khristich, and Nikolai Ganzhuk also died in the crash.

&#x200B;

Memories of the pilot of another helicopter who took part in the aftermath of the accident:

&#x200B;

""We lived in triple rooms in a hotel in Goncharovsk, which is part of a 30-kilometer exclusion zone. What were you doing? They filled the roofs with PVA glue. After all, after the explosion of the fourth reactor, radioactive dust spread to everything ‚Äî to the third reactor, to the second, to everything around.

&#x200B;

This dust cannot be collected with a broom or a vacuum cleaner. Therefore, we hung a 2.5 ton barrel with PVA glue on the external suspension of the helicopter and poured the glue onto the roofs of buildings.

&#x200B;

Then the glue solidified, it was cut into rolls and taken away for recycling. They collected glue, as they were jokingly called, ""biorobots"" ‚Äî conscript soldiers whom I drove from Kiev, from Zhuliany airport. Conscripts worked for a maximum of three months, which they were counted for two years. There were about 20 crews from all over the country in Goncharovsk.

&#x200B;

Someone flew the Mi-26, Mi-24, but they were based in other places. Mi-6 was based in Chernihiv, and we on Mi-8 were based in Goncharovsk. Mi-26s were usually engaged in decontamination of the area. They took on board 20 tons of special liquid and poured it over the territory.

Vovka Vorobyov was from Chita. 

That day we flew to work. We worked all day, made five or six flights each. Each flight takes 20 minutes one way, 20 minutes back. From the railway station where we were refueled, to the reactor and back. Before the last flight, we were refueled, and again we flew to drain this glue.

&#x200B;

And it was already around 17 o'clock, at sunset, and we were setting just against the sun, which was blinding. There were three cranes there, and we complained in the morning that they were bothering us. Previously, there was a rail hanging on the crane cable, but now it was removed, and there was only one cable left, and without the rail it is no longer visible.

&#x200B;

So Vovka got into it, he just didn't notice the cable, because the sun was blinding his eyes.

&#x200B;

And Colonel Vorobyov was flying above us on the Mi-24, guiding us. We fill the roof, and he says, ""Let's go a little to the right, you still have three meters to the wall."" The ventilation pipe is the main unit. And in front of it are stepped buildings, the roofs of which we flooded...There was a case when the flight technician, who was looking down and opening the valve of the barrel, told me: ""Go ahead, go ahead, stop ‚Äî I see the foot of the crane."" And at that moment I could open the blister and touch the faucet with my hand from the cabin...

&#x200B;

I was hanging a hundred meters behind Vovka. Volodka was walking, walking, and then suddenly ‚Äî bang! A splash of blades, the helicopter turns over ‚Äî and down.

&#x200B;

It was over the third reactor, and it was lucky that the helicopter fell from a height of 100 meters not onto the reactor, which was already shut down, but along its wall to the ground. If the Mi-8 had fallen on the reactor with full refueling, there would be a repeat disaster.

&#x200B;

I'm panicking, the commander is yelling into the radio: ""Okay, guys, stand down, everyone merge anywhere, let's go back to the point."" And my first reaction was to sit next to him, but he forbade me to sit down. We returned to Goncharovsk, we were all sitting, jittery, and then at 23 o'clock the commander calls: ""Is Volodka your friend? Fly after him, after the bodies.""

I'm flying, I'm sitting in front of the reactor. A ""bukhanka"" arrives, and brings the bodies, they are badly burned, and we are taking them to the Zhuliany airfield. I asked Vanka to turn on the X‚Äîray meter - the bodies are on the scale, and they lay under the reactor for several hours...",664,0.013883668,0.31648914,12/29/23 10:15

The weighty or sad parts are so inane, they made us laugh out loud. The dialog, plot, and action are predictable, if not outright tedious. Yet, the bad physics provide nonstop surprises.

> It seems that 32 Bostonians have simultaneously dropped dead in a ten-block radius for no apparent reason, and General Purcell wants to know if it was caused by a covert weapon. Of course, the military has been put in charge of the investigation and everything is hush-hush.

> Without examining anything, Keyes takes about five seconds to surmise that the victims all died from malfunctioning pacemakers and the malfunction was definitely not due to a secret weapon. We're supposed to be impressed, but our experience with real scientists and engineers indicates that when they're on-the-record, top-notch scientists and engineers won't even speculate about the color of their socks without looking at their ankles1.

Star Wars is Science-fiction-fantasy, so while things like hover cars are just standard science fiction ""might be possible in the future"" type stuff, the Force is pure magic. 

But Star Wars didn't try to just blatantly get things wrong. in The Core, they directly state that earth's magnetic field shields it from EM radiation. That is just a lie, really, the two things have nothing to do with each other.",10,-0.04453869,0.535297619,3/6/21 21:27

The Electric State,sciencefiction,The Electric State - Reviewed,"Here‚Äôs the primary issue with it; the St√•lenhag book story has almost nothing to do with the movie story.

(NO spoilers ahead)

The book story is atmospheric and character-building, a series of beautiful snapshots and vignettes. It is not the adventure quest of the movie, not the same characters, not the same conflict and goal at all. The movie looks like the book artwork to a significant degree, at least the first half of the movie. They did an excellent job of being faithful to the imagery.

So really what it is, is that the movie was merely *inspired* by the book. They took the suggestion of a worldscape and threw in a canned, predictable Hollywood adventure scenario. That right there is why St√•lenhag is not in the opening credits and only briefly in the closing credits.

I was intensely excited by the prospect of the movie and the previews sold it. But that‚Äôs the thing; the previews themselves were snapshots and in that respect true to the book. Seeing the story is what peeled it off as a different thing altogether.

All of that isn‚Äôt to say I might not give it a second watch, I probably will as the visuals were still fantastic and engaging. If I decouple the movie from the book and think of it only as light entertainment, then I would enjoy it a bit more.

What just occurred to me is the similarities to another Chris Pratt movie, ‚ÄúThe Tomorrow War‚Äù. As far as movies go, it was crap. I lambasted it upon release. Simplistic story, glaring plot holes, technical absurdities, missed story opportunities, all that stuff‚Ä¶ but what it had going for it was good visuals. If you turn off your brain and enjoy it for the shiny object that it is, it‚Äôs representative of this type of quickie production genre.",15,0.153720238,0.543563988,3/16/25 21:31

Robinson Crusoe,soloboardgaming,Thoughts on Robinson Crusoe?,"Yeah, the game can be incredibly difficult. But the awesome thing is *it‚Äôs in the rulebook* that you can make certain tweaks to change the difficulty. The rulebook suggests using the dog with three characters, but nothing is stopping you from throwing in Friday as well. This is one of the simplest and fairest ways to lower the difficulty. And I pretty much only play this way, *because it makes the game more fun for me*. Play your games how you want, get the enjoyment you would like to out of them. The game oozes with theme and playing it slightly easier makes it so much more fun. Enjoy!!",14,0.108174603,0.535873016,6/28/22 15:58
Robinson Crusoe,soloboardgaming,Thoughts on Robinson Crusoe?,"Some scenarios are more random than others, but honestly I mostly just play the first scenario anyway. Most of the randomness comes from the dice, but you can mitigate it through determination tokens and worker allocation. The biggest mistake new players make is trying to spread themselves too thin by doing too many things 

For example, if you NEED to build a rooftop to prepare for an incoming storm, then you should commit 2 actions to ensure it gets done this round instead of trying to do 2 different actions. This is because a lot of actions (like building) come down to dice if you only commit one, and that's what leads to failing and hurting yourself.

The game will still feel random because of events and tile placement, but it will feel much more manageable if you're less greedy with your actions.",8,0.035258838,0.493339646,6/28/22 14:04
Robinson Crusoe,soloboardgaming,Thoughts on Robinson Crusoe?,"I really enjoy it and it‚Äòs probably the most thematic solo-able game I own. The luck factor is perfectly fine for me. It‚Äòs not like you draw a card that annihilates your resources 10 minutes before you could win the game, but instead you usually know how likely the chance for something bad happening is for an individual action and then you have to decide how many risks you‚Äòre willing to take in a round. If I lose (and that happens often), it feels more like I set the wrong priorities during the game, not like I had bad luck. 


A solo playthrough usually takes me around 60 minutes. It can be over in 40 minutes if I make some bad choices and it can take 80 minutes if I get strong analysis paralysis (AP). However, I get AP much more rarely than in e.g. Spirit Island, because in Robinson Crusoe it‚Äòs normally clear what you have to do, you just have to find a way how to do it with your limited actions and resources.",8,0.030687831,0.511463845,6/28/22 16:30

Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,movies,Den of Thieves 2: Pantera.  Far better than it had any business being. ,"Biggest problems I had with this sequel:

1 - Nick is a shell of his former self. He's not funny, he's not the Big Dick Nick baddest MFer in the room anymore. Sequel Nick would never stand a chance against Merrimen. This guy is nothing like the sadistic eat-a-doughnut-from-the-crime-scene-floor guy we found in DoT1. 

2 - Donnie is stupid and gets played. Again, this guy is nothing like the ""I am in control  of my whole environment"" Donnie from DoT2. Donnie literally cuts out guys from his crew who help determine the get-away route...then forgets how pissed he make them. 

3 - The heist itself is enjoyable and well-filmed. There's a enjoyable, well-filmed heist in DoT1, too, but it is bookended with a superb opening scene shootout and concludes with chaotic gun fight through LA streets. This sequel had neither of these things. It had a mafia who was OK with letting Nick & Donnie go and a rave scene. 

4 - Nicks' decision to turn on Donnie, then participate and/or learn of him being busted out, is utterly confusing. 

In whole, if you went to this film hoping for a sequel like DoT1, you didn't get it whatsoever. There's no good action sequences--nothing like DoT1 or THE TOWN or HEAT, the characters' actions grossly contradict their behavior and identities from the first film, and if you went for the action of the first one, it was a snoozefest for nearly the entire runtime.

I liked that there was an inclusion of cultural context about Joplin being at the heart of the Bible belt and how that influenced the way people experienced such a harrowing event. I know some viewers are irked that they left a lot out about the damage or what happened in other parts of the town but I don't mind a narrow focus. I do wish that given the limited scope, it had gone deeper, but it's fine for what it is. 

That said, my god, the unrelated B roll, CG effects, reenactments, etc. were incredibly distracting, especially when I was trying to just soak in the witness testimonies and they were being broken up every other second for yet another lightning flash. I wish they cut 90% of that and used the time to help ground the viewer by showing maps of the route it took and where each survivor was in relation to each other or by including more footage of the tornado itself.",110,0.159457672,0.450992063,3/19/25 21:44

He just kind of showed up in the beginning and there wasn't really any resolution with him other than 'didn't even hit us'. Glad that was the case!

A Quiet Place: Day One,horror,A Quiet Place: Day One started out soo good..,">and all the meaning of what they were trying to accomplish was soooooo stupid.. going to get a slice of pizza?? Fuck off.

On its own it's certainly stupid, but they do a good job of explaining why it's so meaningful to Sam. She has no interest in leaving because there's no real point. She has terminal cancer, and the way she was acting in the clinic as well as at the theater seemed to make it pretty clear that she had very little time left. And that's without even getting into how the country was being invaded by creatures that would make it increasingly harder for her to find the treatment she needed even to make it through however much time she had left. But that pizza represented happiness to her because its something she used to do with her dad. So it was all about her seeking one last moment of happiness before either those creatures got to her or she finally succumbed to cancer.",47,0.06875,0.457894737,7/1/24 2:03

A Quiet Place: Day One,AQuietPlace,A Quiet Place Day One is a huge letdown.,"The movie also fell pretty short for me, and I have a decently sized explanation of why. (Some points I make have a bit of overlap with a couple of your points):

The only character who I ever really felt had a meaningful relationship with Sam was the nurse. And the reason this relationship was meaningful in the first place is because it was shown at the point in the movie that actually had dialogue (the beginning). After the nurse was killed, there was hardly any space left in the movie for dialogue which would make it extremely difficult for Sam to form relationships. By the time Eric was introduced, there was both just not enough time and not enough room in the plot‚Äôs convenience to give him good character development. The only reason he was introduced at all was only because Sam was terminally ill and was unable to make it out alive, so the directors had to give the audience just something, anything to cheer for in the end. This would be perfectly fine if Eric just wasn‚Äôt such a shallow character, and what I mean by this is he just relied on Sam the whole time, and it felt like he couldn‚Äôt do anything on his own. The first time Eric appeared on screen, it was when he barely made it out alive from the subways when he was trying to evacuate. This immediately gave the assumption to the audience that Eric wanted to make it out of New York alive. Yet 2 minutes later, he meets Sam and just starts mindlessly following her around like a dog, and when they actually have a conversation, it consists of Sam telling Eric to go the opposite way to evacuate because her plan is not to evacuate, it‚Äôs to get pizza. And then Eric just doesn‚Äôt go the opposite way to evacuate, he just instead continues to follow this random woman he‚Äôs never seen in his life. I would get the whole thing like oh Eric wants to stay with Sam and help her because she‚Äôs his friend, but no, the dude just met her and had only heard like 2 words come out of her mouth by that point. Like is this guy suicidal? He clearly wanted to evacuate based on his attempt at making it through the subways earlier, yet when he meets this random lady who clearly doesn‚Äôt want to even be around him, he just puts his personal goals aside and no longer cares about evacuating? His reasoning for even being interested in Sam in the first place isn‚Äôt even explained either, so why even bother with her at all? And earlier when I stated that he can‚Äôt do anything independently, there is actually one particular scene where he goes of on his own to get Sam‚Äôs meds for her which leads to Eric discovering the nest of all the aliens, but I‚Äôll get to that later on. Either way, I just see Eric as an uninteresting character whose clumsiness just ultimately lands him and Sam in chase scenes that feel more annoying than satisfying because Eric shows no signs of sympathy after almost getting the both of them killed. And to add on to this, because of Eric‚Äôs unlikable nature, it didn‚Äôt feel at all rewarding when he made it to the boat at the end of the movie. And Sam‚Äôs ending was just pitiful. The directors could‚Äôve made the ending at least a little more meaningful if they had just sacrificed Sam‚Äôs life to save Eric. But no, instead they make Eric once again rely on Sam to make it to the boat, and Sam just literally survives only to kill herself at the very end of the movie. Why not just sacrifice her? You set up a perfect reason to because of the fact that she‚Äôs terminally ill, you‚Äôve set up a friend that she cares about, she‚Äôs going to die anyways, so why not make her die in a meaningful way?

And then that cat‚Ä¶ The only reason over half the plot points happened was because of that cat. It‚Äôs the only character that had some reason to care for on an emotional level (literally just because it‚Äôs cute), yet it was just so conveniently well trained and never caused problems. I have a lot of complaints with the plot points that were driven by the cat, but I‚Äôll talk about one specific one, one I mentioned earlier that I would talk about again. When Eric was getting Sam‚Äôs meds and the cat tagged along and ran off, Eric went to climb up a small bit of a tower to save the cat. This led to him discovering the location of the nest of all the aliens. I‚Äôll start by saying first off, every time the cat has run off, it‚Äôs been completely fine. It felt pretty stupid for Eric to chase after the cat at all considering the cat presented itself as smart and independent. Yet Eric decided to chase after it thus showing the audience the hive of the aliens. When this happened, I was like oh finally, something cool is  about to happen. BUT NO! All that happens is a few aliens ran by, a couple eggs were shown, and then IT JUST CUT BACK TO ERIC BEING WITH SAM. He was in an extremely precarious situation, so how in the heck did he get out of it? Well the movie just decided to not show us that. The movie just constantly hints at entertaining things to come yet those things just never happen. I thought it was be really cool for a plot point to be to destroy that nest, or at least destroy some eggs maybe causing a distraction for some reason (or idk just anything cool to happen in that place), but that whole area was just never shown again. 

The movie also just didn‚Äôt do a great job at expanding on the quiet place universe or explaining any sort of backstory of where the aliens even came from. And why was it just not suspenseful at all? It clearly tried to take a more emotional way of storytelling when compared to the first two movies, but because Sam and Eric hardly even had an interesting connection, none of the emotion felt too real. There were also tons of plot holes. Like I mentioned, the cat was just so conveniently well trained and didn‚Äôt meow even a single time. Another thing is that some extremely quiet sounds would attract monsters while other extremely loud sounds wouldn‚Äôt attract monsters. And why weren‚Äôt the aliens attracted to sounds that other aliens made? Why didn‚Äôt the government just make a singular blaring alarm for the whole duration of the movie so that the aliens were just attracted to said alarm so that everybody could just easily evacuate? Why was a terminally ill woman able to just outrun insane, blood-thirsty aliens? Why did it take only 5 minutes for Sam to discover that the aliens were blind? Why was there that one extremely freaking annoying character in the beginning of the movie who just kept screaming ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna die‚Äù? There were just so many things wrong with Day One and it‚Äôs so painful to see how much wasted potential it has. The way I see it, A Quiet Place: Day One just feels like a poorly made spin off rather than a prequel.",3,0.03884557,0.531883373,7/7/24 17:42
A Quiet Place: Day One,AQuietPlace,A Quiet Place Day One is a huge letdown.,"I agree it was a let down the criticism that people wouldn‚Äôt notice sound is what attracts the aliens until later doesn‚Äôt seem to hold true.

Cause I think everyone‚Äôs first reaction would be to run and hide while they‚Äôre hiding the ones who move and make noise die you can catch on quickly. Lots of people will die first but those who just stopped what they‚Äôre doing completely absolutely would put 2 and 2 together imo. That wasn‚Äôt a flaw in the movie imo. 

The cat was cute af but annoying the since that it didn‚Äôt behave cat like. He woulda dipped after they took a swim, he would‚Äôve meowed his ass off when food came, the cat would make some noise from being scared or hungry.

I Highly recommend it! Chaos is still a fascinating read. Finished it in a day or two. Still was a bit disappointed. It wasn‚Äôt something really new. It was speculated long ago how could it be that Manson wasn‚Äôt taken into custody way earlier, despite of violating his parole agreement numerous times. Especially after the Spahn ranch raid. Also the possible intelligence connections with the free medical clinic in San Francisco was discussed way before. 

The whole topic is a fascinating rabbit hole to dive into for sure!! It somehow is made out as tom O‚ÄôNeill was the first person coming up with such ideas and theories and after 20 years of research and writing the book I had expected a bit more: like really new information. There are still a few pieces he dug up which were new and fascinating to read about and he got the whole thing back out of the shadows and people are talking about it - like you and that‚Äôs neat I think. Go right ahead and dive  head first into the topic!

After they were done, Eddie left a tip, but he also unintentionally left a bit of the symbiote behind.

There were some funny moments in it which was nice I guess though I don't see story-wise why venom would risk transforming just to dance with Mrs. Chen seeing how afraid he is of the xenophages.

I also expected the other symbiotes to be more involved instead of just becoming fodder to the xenophages immediately after being introduced.

Overall, I was really disappointed. I really enjoyed the previous venom movies (despite what people say about let there be carnage) and this one just didn't feel like it lived up to that. I guess I'm also disappointed it'll be the last one.",12,-0.023484848,0.610606061,10/27/24 3:32
Venom: The Last Dance,thevenomsite,Just watched Venom: The Last Dance. I'm confused,"I can‚Äôt find the answer I already did for this question but basically : situational awareness.

The symbiotes want the Codex gone because if a Xenophage gets it Knull will be free and everyone will die. Thing is, the Xenophages were already there. Right now. In the lab.

If they had raced to kill Venom‚Ä¶ well first of all Eddie and the symbiote survived Riot, Carnage and a Xenophage multiple times. You really think a C-list symbiote had a shot at getting them ? Or that they would let themselves be killed ? And even if the symbiotes had all gotten together to try and kill Venom, there‚Äôs no way they would have been faster or more effective to it than the Xenophages, who amidst the bloodshed could quite easily still siphon the Codex from Venom's body. It was a strategic choice because a Hail Mary, desperate attempt to kill the main character and let the Xenophages devour them all right after was not a good idea. I think if they had all been in a room in a normal settings the symbiotes would have tried to get them somehow but the priority for the sake of EVERYONE right now was moreso to get the Codex as far away from Knull's hounds as possible.

Second, there‚Äôs also the fact that they may not WANT to kill Venom. Sure they know it‚Äôs a thing that needs to happen but even the green symbiote Mulligan had was saying ""Venom must be killed."", not ""kill that mf on spot hell, I‚Äôll do it myself if I have the opportunity."" Not everyone would be ready to kill another human, who all in all did a lot more good than bad and just wants to live their life, to prevent Armageddon. We‚Äôve seen violent symbiotes previously but there‚Äôs no telling that even the simplest symbiotes are hostile with one another, when they worked together in the past to trap Knull. Plus these symbiotes are tied to the Hive too, they KNOW who Venom is, what they did and how the symbiote turned the page to appreciate his host and live a heroic life. And they like Earth and humans too, because of him most likely, for all we know Venom could very much be their hero, someone they root for.",15,0.111755652,0.510815697,3/26/25 16:32

Sicario,movies,Sicario (2015) ‚Äì a lot of style but a weak plot,"> Emily Blunt's character Kate Macer (and the FBI in general) seemed to have no purpose in the movie. Yes, I get that the FBI's presence was needed to legitimize Brolin's character's actions, but from a storytelling perspective, her character seemed the main (flimsy) obstacle to Brolin, condemning his methods the whole way. But if the audience's protagonist (since she was being introduced to all the savagery of the cartel alongside the audience) is only used as a vehicle by the supporting cast, then why bother having her in the movie at all?

This is the whole point of the movie. We, the audience, are idealistic and ignorant about what's really going on at and over the border. Emily Blunt's character is us. The movie is a tragedy. And in a certain sense, it's a horror movie. It's just a lot more real than a lot of horror movies.",147,0.198095238,0.44547619,10/8/21 9:33
Sicario,movies,Sicario (2015) ‚Äì a lot of style but a weak plot,"This:

>Yes, I get that the FBI's presence was needed to legitimize Brolin's character's actions,

contradicts this:

> but from a storytelling perspective, her character seemed the main (flimsy) obstacle to Brolin, condemning his methods the whole way. 

Kate is boxed in. She spends the movie working out that she's being used by the CIA and her boss at the FBI. 

>But if the audience's protagonist (since she was being introduced to all the savagery of the cartel alongside the audience) is only used as a vehicle by the supporting cast, then why bother having her in the movie at all? 

Villeneuve sets Kate up as a surrogate for the audience. We're meant to experience the film's violence through her. Her inability/unwillingness to act reflects our inability/unwillingness to act. Alejandro isn't just warning Kate, here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDJJBMXiwiI

He's really warning us.

This:

>Could've easily just had some FBI agent as an extra.It seemed like her only point in the movie was to legitimize, be seduced, nearly killed, then saved by the supporting cast, then told to stay in the back, etc. She never really did anything by herself, because Brolin's character didn't let her do anything. And again, I get that was the point of them only being there to get rid of red tape, but I feel like that was really unsatisfying (and rather patronizing) storytelling. I'm fine with unconventional storytelling, I mean No Country for Old Men is absolutely brilliant (and their main character frickin' dies off-screen near the end) but at least Brolin's character in that one got to do drive the story for a while. Even her partner seemed more capable than her in getting Brolin's character to involve them a bit more.
   
>Even at the border crossing, Kate Macer got upset that the soldiers killed those cartel thugs ‚Äì I mean what were they supposed to do? They repeatedly told the thugs to stand down and only shot them when they were about to fire. Isn't that standard procedure in law enforcement in the US? What was Macer's problem? I get that she was worried about civilians but the soldiers didn't intend to shoot.

was the point. Kate behaving like a real person. She is so overwhelmed by the story's stakes that she can't, necessarily, have agency. This is what Alejandro is talking about when he warns her that she needs to leave.

>    It felt like they were treating Brolin's character / Graves' CIA reveal like a plot twist, but didn't they heavily imply and even state it before he admitted it himself? 

The film doesn't treat Brolin's character's job as a twist. Kate identifies him as a CIA operative almost immediately after meeting him. The twist is that everything the CIA uses Kate for is a diversion to get Alejandro down the Mexico side of the tunnel so he can kill the cartel's leaders.

>    In the opening act ‚Äì the house was a horrifying but really cool visual setpiece with the corpses in the walls but‚Ä¶ what was the point? Why would the cartel hide 35+ corpses in some house's walls? 

Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.

>Why was there some guy playing video games in there, the stench alone must have been awful. The corpses were all in relatively same-y state of decomposition, so it feels like they must have built the house around the corpses quite recently. 

Yep.

>Why not just dump the bodies in the huge, surrounding desert?

*Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.*

>Was there a truck filled with corpses in that neighbourhood and they expected nobody to notice? My one guess is the cartel wanted that house to make the news to shock people but feels like there would've been way easier ways to do that.

Kate is an FBI agent who handles hostage negotiations.

The cartel lured her team to a booby-trapped house full of dead hostages. 

A team member sets off a booby-trap. The raid and the bodies and the dead FBI agents make the news and anyone paying attention knows that the cartel did it.

This was a message to the cartel's employees, rivals, enemies, and to the US government.

>Her partner and she conveniently run into a corrupt cop (Jon Bernthal) at the bar even though her partner didn't exactly tell anyone where they were going. 

Kate's partner already knew Jon Bernthal's character. He wanted to set Kate up with him romantically.

>And then they reveal it was all part of Alejandro's trap ‚Äì that just added to the weird feeling that the ""good guys""' plan was never in doubt.

It wasn't Alejandro's trap. Alejandro had nothing to do with the set-up. He was able to save Kate because he was following her.

>Also isn't Blunt's character a trained SWAT team leader? 

No. 

>Why wouldn't she be able to fight off some corrupt police officer?

She's not an action hero, she's a lawyer who became an FBI negotiator.

~~I don't think she ever fires a gun in the film~~ She kills at least two people in the film. I need to retthink this; which is why Alejandro is right when he tells her she's not cut out of the work she's doing.",33,0.053154078,0.50583607,10/8/21 10:30

If you wanna have trials with this sort of outcome then we have to sue car manufacturers like Ford & GM for creating something that can be used to end innocent lives. Then food companies, and gas stations because they sell lottery tickets and unhealthy items which can lead to compulsive gambling or cancer & food poisoning. Alcohol, tobacco, bow companies, knife companies, tool companies since the screw driver is the third most commonly used deadly weapon. I can go on an on. 

You can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs different. Different how?? Almost anything can be used irresponsibly. It‚Äôs a human problem, not an item problem.

If you could wave your hand and make every gun on this planet disappear then tomorrow on the news they‚Äôll be talking about a bombing, a stabbing,arson, a cross bow killing‚Ä¶etc etc etc. 

If man wants to kill he will figure out a way to do it. This movie was ridiculous, naive, immature, and further more, impossible. It‚Äôs just like throwing drug dealers in prison who sell a drug that kills somebody. People that do drugs love them and want them, and someone or something is always going to be there to provide it for them.

Especially if you‚Äôre one of those anti drug hypocrites that consumes alcohol, smokes cigarettes and gambles. 

You‚Äôre all full of sh!t",28,-0.03125,0.535416667,10/5/23 13:46

Lydia Deetz is a character in the 2003 movie Runaway Jury. She is a goth juror who replaces a dismissed alcoholic juror. Corri English plays Lydia Deetz. 
Explanation
Lydia Deetz's name is also the name of a character in the 1988 movie Beetlejuice, played by Winona Ryder. However, in Runaway Jury, the last name is spelled Deetz.

Apparently, the interior designer was working very closely and on commission for many years with a client with too much money to spend.  The paragraph of what reads like an ad for an estate sale with prices for individual chandeliers, etc. is interesting.

The photos don't really give a good idea what it looks like on the outside or how large it is.  The Google Street View and the satellite map view are more helpful than the listing in that respect and you can also get an idea about the neighborhood from the street view.

To Catch a Killer,movies,To Catch A Killer: Discussion,"Same, I was searching for a review thread as well as I just watched it on streaming today!

**Pros:** Good acting from the two leads, and honestly production values were surprisingly high for a stand-alone mid-budget film - it didn't look any worse than any of the Netflix films that have come out this year.

**Cons:** The plot was unrealistic with one man killing over 50 people including trained cops, and not even sustaining a scratch on himself. Also, he commits these murders in places with plenty of cameras such as a mall and apparently no one is able to find him except a rookie cop and a FBI agent?!

**Overall To Catch a Killer (2023) film rating: 6/10**, a mid-budget crime thriller that doesn't need to be seen on the big screen but still worth watching from home.",93,0.112307692,0.418461538,5/18/23 23:46
To Catch a Killer,movies,To Catch A Killer: Discussion,"Decided to put this one on since I wasn't in the mood for much and I like Shailene. Very different than her other recent project, Robots, lol

I thought it was pretty good. Not fantastical, but not bad. Definitely has some unbelievability in a few areas. Solid overall and tries to keep things grounded. Great performances if nothing else. Also enjoyed some of the score. I worried it'd be a drag with the 2 hr runtime, but the pacing worked.

I think the ""but, wait-"" moments can be chalked up to incompetence, human error, and unpredictability/how we react to it in the moment. It happens irl. The scene where Eleanor tries to get the old guy out of the shop was a great demonstration of that. The amount of precision kills seemed like too much for one guy on the lam in the US (very video game protagonist), but eh, what do I know.

I found most of the characters compelling and sympathetic for the amount of time we had with them. Some things are left to the imagination and eye to pick up on, and others are a little more expository. I liked that they aimed for nuance. It would've made for a good mini series. The camera work and performances, while certainly not bad, reminded me of an HBO-adjacent show. 

**On details:**

The scenes in the office when Eleanor is feeling drained were done well. You get the impression it's her usual, but even worse now, and yet she trucks on in her duty. I hated hearing everyone's phones constantly going off (especially Mackenzie's), the constant noises in the room, intrusions, etc. It made me feel not only what a character might be subconsciously feeling in that moment or every day, but came back around to Dean's character motivations.

There are a few instances where you can spot tiny social politics at play that you think might culminate to something on its own, but are really just... realistic, and not the full focus, which I appreciated in this case. Like Eleanor being told to take the baby as the only woman in the room, Mackenzie's interactions with other black characters as a man of the law, people making a stink about a presumably-homeless person just trying to wash/eat, Eleanor thinking Geoffrey has predatory motives when she gets in the car with him, even after he says he's married, but before he lets on that he's gay, and so on. They play into the story and characters without being in service of a single obvious message. 

I also thought the scenes of her struggling mentally/emotionally when she's off duty were done very well. Bonus points for having the character actually living in a not-so-nice apartment. I mean, it wasn't awful, especially given she has access to a pool, but realistic enough. I swear every ""financially struggling"" character out of Hollywood lives in a nice place while implying it's a dump. It's borderline insulting to people who've actually lived or live in sh*tty places (or even modest houses at this point) that they call home. And it paid off in a realization.

ETA: Another detail I liked was regarding the shooting - how the gunfire goes well beyond reasonable for a guy who's already bleeding out. Almost to a comedic degree. It comes off like every person there wanted to get their shot in just to say they took down a big bad guy. The PR/power angle is mentioned a couple times throughout, so I figure this was intentional.",87,0.082108732,0.480515873,5/22/23 3:33

To Catch a Killer,movies,To Catch A Killer: Discussion,"I thought it was actually horrible.  Acting was solid from everyone, but it felt like the screenwriter was just using everyone as a prop to give a speech to the audience.  The police response to the mass shooting events just seemed so ridiculously unrealistic that it took me way out of the movie.  No explanation of how he was able to get out of the mall when there was already SWAT presence so presumably they would have surrounded or watched the exits.  

The discussion at the end in the house just went on way too long.  Was hoping for a much more interesting investigation as well, there was really only a single break in the case which was her just having a sudden realization that the one guy was outsourcing his work, from there everything is just immediately revealed/told instead of discovered.

I feel like if they made the antagonist commit more smaller sets of attacks where only 4-5 people were hit each time it would be way more realistic instead of these mass attacks, then that would also let them pace the investigation reveals better instead of it all just being dumped/revealed at once at the end.  And I think they needed to give a better reason for Eleanor to actually be so involved in the investigation, either by being connected to it or her actually finding a clue first before being brought in, since from how it plays out it seems like Lammark only brings her in because he overhears her speculation/response in the break room at the start.  Although it was nice how they had her think to record the people leaving.  Overall it just felt too ridiculous at the end, camerawork/acting were good though.",95,0.125457875,0.530998168,5/21/23 0:37

I absolutely love the opening scene. Really sets the tone and it keeps you hooked as a viewer. You can feel the terror and the story gets setup pretty nicely that way. 

Sadly it doesn‚Äôt find a way to keep that suspend and pacing and the movie kind of loses itself in the middle. The ending is a bit better and I think the movie has a very interesting suspect. 

Some shots are amazing though. The first mall shot we get immediately takes you back to the opening scene, you know somethings gonna happen and I felt my eyes searching the frame for the suspect.

So, they like to attack her for being hypocritical about burning too much jet fuel, or not having children, whatever. 

It's like finding out that the new lead singer for Linken Park, while looking and sounding amazing, is against treating mental illnesses because she doesn't believe in them. This is a band where most of their songs are about trying to cope with...checks notes...mental illness.

The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep,witcher,Official Discussion - The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep [SPOILERS],"I guess i am just gonna post it here because apparently we arent allowed a separate posts..

My impressions.

Hello everybody, I once again made a mistake by watching yet another NETFLIX Witcher content, this time the ""adaptation"" of my favourite short story, A Little Sacrifice.

I am not gonna go much into the actual anime aspect of it since I mostly care about the lore and the story.

NETFLIX completely butchered that on so many levels, it's unreal.

First of all, the conflict between fish-people and humans is just a backdrop in the book. It's not the main plot of the story. The main plot revolves around Geralt and Essi and their complicated relationship. Geralt, obviously having feelings for Essi, cannot give her what she wants since he is fully in love with Yen, and so he cannot properly express his feelings. The entire premise of that story is that Geralt is essentially trying to make sense of his feelings while there is this love story between mermaid and the duke going on.

The Anime made it all about the conflict, and no, not just that one skirmish Geralt had with the fishpeople when he and Dandelion discovered the stairs into the deeps, there are so many action scenes and a literally full blown war going on, while the main aspect of the story, that being Geralt and Essi being woefully overlooked.

What drives me nuts is that at times, it LOOKED like they wanted to adapt the story properly, but then they just... fumbled it? Like there is this scene where both Essi and Geralt are on that balcony during the night and it looks like they might kiss like in the book (which is something Geralt IMMEDIETLY regrets), but nothing happens.

Then there is this pearl hunting thing going on and you think they might introduce that pearl Geralt gives Essi as a gift, you know that pearl¬†>!She keeps with her for the rest of her life, the pearl she is buried with, the pearl that meant so much for her because it reminded her of Geralt!<

But no, that pearl never shows up, literally the most important object in the whole story is ommited...

Oh yea, and remember that powerful scene where Sheenaz makes the LITTLE SACRIFICE for the Duke and decides to live among the humans? You know, to forsake everything she loved as a mermaid just to be with her love of her life? THEY FUCKING REVERSED IT in the Anime. Because we live in the 21st century and it would be seen as ""patriarchal"" for a woman to make a sacrifice for a man. So in the Anime its the DUKE who forsakes everything for her instead... of course he does.

Oh yea, and that extremely tragic ending everybody remembers this specific story for? Yea, they didnt do it.

Anyways, this is already long as it is. It is just mindless action about the conflict that is not even important for the story itself, with some good (Doug) and some really fucking bad (voice actress who voices Essi) voiceacting. It is just another hollow shell of a potentialy amazing story that Netflix writers just cant comprehend.",302,0.12229207,0.462765957,2/11/25 8:33

The Menu,movies,"Can anyone who's watched ""The Menu (2022)"" answer these questions?","Alright, I‚Äôm no movie expert and have never really been great at identifying underlying symbolism in film. However, I have worked for years in some of the best known restaurants at roughly the level Hawthorne is meant to represent. I attended the Culinary Institute of America, worked for free at the Restaurant at Meadowood in Napa Valley for about a year, worked for about 4 years under Dan Barber at Blue Hill and Blue hill at Stone Barns in New York, and did a brief stint in Mexico at Quitonil, as well as years at a number of lesser known Michelin rated restaurants, all as a cook and sous chef. I was even present for the filming of the Chef‚Äôs Table episode on Dan Barber. So I feel that I have a vantage point that hasn‚Äôt been expressed here thus far.

1. The cooks were obsessed with the Chef because that is the prevailing culture in these restaurants. It‚Äôs how it works. The sense of hierarchy in these places is very clear and very strong. Every cook there wants to be there because they someday imagine themselves being that chef, despite the reality that a vanishingly small number of them will ever come close. You work 16 or more hours a day, six days a week very closely with other young people who share your mindset. It is your life. You don‚Äôt have any time for hobbies or family or outside friends, the place you work is your life. It‚Äôs so easy to be utterly consumed by it. We used to joke that everyone who worked at Blue Hill eventually had to drink the kool aid, a reference to Jonestown, as in the cult. It really did feel cultish, especially looking back now. Everyone worked extremely hard for the chef‚Äôs approval, even if it was rarely given. I found this part of the film was very accurate.

2. My guess is that he obsessed over Margot because he had a different name on the guest list and it had been changed without notice. Chefs at this level are hyper detail-oriented, and are naturally obsessed with controlling every aspect of the experience they are creating in their restaurant. Little changes can derail a service, cause seemingly irrational blowups, and lead to over-the-top displays of emotion. I have seen grown men throw tantrums and smash plates with food against the wall over trivial mistakes. As for the barrel, she does bring in a barrel, it‚Äôs what is on the counter when he sets the place on fire, leading to the explosion. I assume it was filled with some explosive materials. The replacement line I assume has to do with how competitive these work environments can be, as I stated above, the chef‚Äôs approval is highly sought after by all of the staff, especially the middle and upper management.

3. My best guess about the replica of the restaurant in his cabin is that the restaurant is his life. Even when he leaves an goes home, he never leaves. I own my own restaurant now, and can really relate to this, I‚Äôm never off, and at the highest level of restaurants it‚Äôs much more intense than what I deal with. One of the chefs I worked for always used to say that his life sucked and he wished he had become a dentist. This despite having climbed to the highest level of esteem and success in his industry.

4. This I don‚Äôt know, but it seems to be a common horror movie trope. The characters never take their chances to get out alive.

5. This character represents a contingent commonly referred to as ‚Äúfoodies‚Äù. They flock to these types of restaurants, incessantly photographing the food, giving their opinion despite having no depth to their knowledge of food beyond what the‚Äôve googled. Chefs hate these types of customers. It‚Äôs not impressive that you know why we‚Äôre using copper pots and bowls, or what a Paco Jet is. Maybe it‚Äôs pretentious to dislike this person, but it‚Äôs also not endearing for someone to be so needy for the chef‚Äôs approval despite having no real understanding of the years of toil and sacrifice the chef went through to develop their craft. These are the people who write long reviews with lots of poorly lit pictures on yelp, seeming to believe that their opinion on someone‚Äôs life work needs to be in the public domain. Any idiot can go and eat at a restaurant, or learn what bergamot tastes like, but it takes decades of dedication to master a craft, and restaurants are incredibly difficult businesses to run, much less keep profitable. 

6. Not sure on this, again it‚Äôs a movie, and it had to end somehow. I suppose that showing her eating the final thing that the chef personally cooked (the burger being the representation of ‚Äúreal food‚Äù and something that the chef seemingly loved and had lost touch with), wiping her mouth with the pretentious menu of bullshit, and viewing the conclusion of his masterpiece wrapped it up pretty well in my opinion. I think that the movie definitely had a heavy hand with the class struggle messaging, but the director isn‚Äôt known for nuance and subtlety in his messages. 

I really liked the film, but I think that some elements could easily be lost on people who have never worked in restaurants at the level portrayed in the film, or at least eaten in one. It‚Äôs a world that you wouldn‚Äôt know exists if you didn‚Äôt see it for yourself.",2015,0.040980913,0.544265381,12/13/22 17:58

The Menu,movies,"Can anyone who's watched ""The Menu (2022)"" answer these questions?","This isn‚Äôt meant to  sound pretentious or film snobby, but to answer any of these questions you have to realise the movie is mostly a social commentary/satire and think of what the director is trying to represent and symbolise through the characters and plot, rather than take it super literally like say Top Gun.

Some things are purposefully OTT to be either be funny and/or hammer home a point. 

1) Literally, it‚Äôs an exaggeration on some high end restaurants where the head chef is like a cult leader and they‚Äôd do anything for him. Metaphorically it‚Äôs basically a dig at the pretentious/artsy types who will be bought into their ‚Äòart‚Äô that they would do anything for it, such as commit suicide for one of the dishes. In this movie it‚Äôs the food world but you probably know some coffee/movie/music snobs in your own life. Other examples of this are the snobbery that the meat is matured for EXACTLY 52 days as if one or two days either side would be awful. It‚Äôs also heavily implied the team are a cult ie. live on the island etc.

2) The first obsession he has is because she is a replacement. She wasn‚Äôt reserved. That‚Äôs a pretty big deal in places like this. More importantly, she wasn‚Äôt a bad person or deserve to die like the rest. That‚Äôs my opinion why he‚Äôs so shocked she‚Äôs there, he knows her fate. 

The right hand has worked up to this prestigious position (again, like point one, it‚Äôs a bit of a dig/exaggeration). It‚Äôs like the highest honour after being Chef himself. But she says the attention Margot is getting, and more importantly that Margot was asked to get the barrel, not her. To the right hand this is him replacing her with Margot, making her more important‚Ä¶ even tho Margot has no interest.

3) The kitchen = shows how obsessive he is. This is his whole life. He‚Äôs a maniac. 

We have to assume behind the door in the restaurant is similar. Showing his past, how he used to be happy before the service industry took over his life.


4) It‚Äôs basically an air of acceptance. Their on an island, out numbered by chefs with knives and maybe guns. They did call for help and it was a chef who was in on it. They could have tried to run and scream but it‚Äôs a bit redundant by that point. 

I also think the imagery of them sitting their accepting their fate as s‚Äômores is also just a little poignant to who these people are (assholes) compared to normal people who probably would have put  up a fight 


5) that‚Äôs basically the point of his character - he‚Äôs that super artsy annoying kind who thinks he‚Äôs sooo smart about his subject matter (for him, food). It‚Äôs like that person who thinks they know what camera a movie was filmed on, or someone who can tell where a coffees country of origin is with 1 sip. 

The chef hates him for being this person who ‚Äúknows everything‚Äù but when he made him actually cook, he was shit.

It‚Äôs also a social commentary on people who criticise others but also can‚Äôt do it. ‚ÄúAh Tom Brady is washed up and past it‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt throw a ball themselves.

6) Well yes because it‚Äôs a dark comedy, it isn‚Äôt an action movie where she‚Äôll somehow save the day and the all live. She tried that (coast guard call) and failed. By that point, she‚Äôs done what she had to do to escape‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt it pretty normal to do so? I doubt if I had that boat I would turn back and run either l. 

Very long winded answer, happy to elaborate or expand further if you have any more questions. 

Again this stems from realising the movie is a commentary/symbolism based, not a movie where the people are normal and do normal shit.

Even the fact the washed up actor was written for Daniel Radcliffe originally, when Chef is played by Voldemort. There probably would have been a Harry Potter line somewhere. The movie is kind of purposefully ‚Äúon the nose‚Äù",145,0.091654971,0.566923963,1/6/23 6:19

The Tomb of the Unknown soldier is a somber piece of history. Built I believe following WWI, the tomb honors all soldiers who are lost to war, but especially those who go unrecovered. 

I think in the US we here a lot about no man left behind. And while maybe in modern combat that's ""easier"" to achieve I imagine unfortunately some never make it home.

I think the thought of not recovering a soldier would be far more common in WW1 and WW2, maybe Vietnam, where the chaos and ferocity of battle doesn't allow for it.

Jackson's great, Ronan and Tucci are pitch perfect, but the film (at least for me) has a tone issue and the parents casting. Neither Whalberg or Weisz convince me of their characters, and I feel there casting should have been someone else. Whalberg was a last minute casting choice and that really comes off, it just feels like who they had available. This, maybe, could have been fine but Ronan and Tucci are so superb it really sticks out. The movie also shifts tones at times rather jarringly, and I find some moments from the book could have been translated better. I like how Jackson set up everything to the first acts end, but then I feel the film has a structure issue up until the last few minutes.

She was probably in shock and got caught up with the material which kept her from realizing she was in danger until it was nearly too late. 

>Also, she breaks into a dude's house looking for evidence and doesn't put on gloves first? 

Yea I agree about contaminating the evidence, but she might have been so hellbent on simply finding any evidence of his guilt that she overlooked wearing gloves.

>why is she not screaming bloody murder and calling for help??

She had just fallen off the roof, knocking the wind out of her, and she knew he was closing in on her. Probably just focused on getting away more than anything. 

>Then she calmly walks into her parents house, no urgency, and sits around to watch thier little heart-felt reunion??

Honestly, I don't remember the part with her parents reuniting. She could have just been happy to see them together again and briefly lost focus.

I mean she was 13, it's not like she can go out driving and look for him. She also had no clue where he went, so I don't really think calling the police would have turned up anything either.

""At Evensong one night, while Holly played at sax and Mrs. Bethel Utemeyer joined in, I saw him: Holiday, racing past a fluffy white Samoyed.

Their cere (the bit above their beak) goes brown if they're a girl, and blue if they're a boy. Bruce's cere went blue. So I thought she was a boy. She was angry as hell as a tiny budge - she always had an attitude. So her name was Bruce the Big Tough Budgie. But then her cere reverted back to brown, and suddenly I had an angry girl birb named Bruce.

Scream VI,movies,New Poster for ‚ÄòScream VI‚Äô,"Took me a bit to figure out what it meant but it's pretty clear in hindsight. 

Each track is a Scream movie and the stops are the names of the characters that died in that movie including the killers. You can see which track belongs to which movie on the top left. Kirby Reed's station in the 4th track is closed because she had originally died in Scream 4 but they decided to bring her back for this one. The ominous under construction Sam Carpenter station is pretty dope.

Another cool detail is Maureen Prescott, Syndey's mom, in the first track. She died before the first movie starts but it's revealed she was killed by Billy Loomis.",4705,0.16875,0.420833333,1/1/23 12:36
Scream VI,HolyShitHistory,"In 897, Pope Stephen VI had his dead predecessor, Pope Formosus, dug up, dressed in papal robes, and put on trial. They propped his corpse on a throne, screamed at it, found him guilty, and threw his body in the river.","In one of the most unhinged episodes in papal history, Pope Stephen VI literally put a corpse on trial.

This was in 897 AD. Stephen had serious beef with his predecessor, Pope Formosus, so after Formosus died, Stephen had his body dug up, dressed in papal robes, and propped up on a throne inside a courtroom.

This whole event was called the Cadaver Synod. Stephen ranted at the corpse while a deacon was forced to speak on behalf of the dead pope. Unsurprisingly, the corpse lost the case.

Formosus was found guilty of ""illegally"" being pope. They stripped the body of its robes, cut off three of his fingers, and tossed it into the Tiber River.

The people of Rome were not thrilled. The whole thing was so disturbing that Stephen was arrested shortly after‚Äîand strangled to death in prison.

And that‚Äôs how one pope‚Äôs grudge led to a literal zombie trial.

> Teenagers following the #gentleminions trend have been accused of making noise and throwing things during screenings.


> A staff member at one venue told the BBC they wanted to ensure the experience was not spoiled for younger children on their first cinema trip.


> Some cinemas said they have had to give huge numbers of refunds.


> Videos showing young people dressing up in suits to watch the movie in large groups and cheering loudly during the screening have gone viral on TikTok, racking up millions of views in some cases.


> The teenagers filmed themselves copying the characteristic steepled fingers of the movie's supervillain Felonious Gru and celebrated that ""the five year wait is over"" - referring to the time since the franchise's last instalment, Despicable Me 3.

> Movie studio Universal Pictures endorsed the trend, saying on Twitter: ""to everyone showing up to @Minions in suits: we see you and we love you"".

> But cinemas have been less appreciative, with several complaining about the behaviour of the young fans drawn to the movie by TikTok.


> Guernsey's only cinema had to cancel further screenings of the movie, blaming ""stunningly bad behaviour"", including vandalism, throwing objects and abusing staff.

Carry-On,BuyItForLife,BIFL Request - Carry On Luggage,"I have been using a Victorinox Werks Traveller 6.0 Global Carry-On for several years now and been really happy with it. Plenty of space, sturdy design and some thoughtful design flourishes. I have the 4-wheel version, but I believe it comes in a 2 wheel version too, if you want the extra space. It would be worth checking its dimensions against airlines you will most likely fly on as I know they vary, and this is probably on the upper limit. But I use it mostly for short trips around Europe, and it's fine for airlines like BA. I usually pair it with the corresponding 15"" laptop bag that fits on the trolley handle, and is within the dimensions of a carry-on personal item too.   
  
One thing I would say is that if it's really overpacked, it is prone to tipping forward if nudged. I think that's probably the case with most luggage though, unless it has the specific asymmetrical design like TravelPro does with the chunky bottoms on their cases.",2,0.231481481,0.376388889,8/12/22 22:44

To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before,AmIOverreacting,My son just told me he is gay. AIO?,"Hi. Lesbian here. First off, I think you did an amazing job in your reaction to your son telling you he's gay. I've had to come out to my mom three times now, and her reactions ranged from ""It's just a phase"" to ""You need to talk to God about it."" So you showing love and support was definitely the correct response.

In reading your post, I do think you could benefit from doing some research on the LGBTQ+ community. I mostly want to point out that sexuality and gender expression are two very different things (this is in regards to the makeup thing). Most people are used to the stereotype that gay men are flamboyant and feminine, and gay women are supwr butch and masculine, but that does not describe *all* gay men and women. Who we sleep with does not dictate how we look. If your son wants to wear makeup, cool, but it's not like, a requirement to be a gay man. 

The last thing I wanted to say, in regards to when he starts dating, please acknowledge it. Be excited for him. Ask him questions. Speaking from first hand experience here - I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 9 months and every time I bring her up with my mom, I get zero acknowledgment, and the conversation quickly changes to something else. After 30 years of hiding who I was, it sucks to feel like I still need to hide myself from my mom. Just keep doing what you're doing. You're on the right track so far. Be supportive. Be curious. Make jokes (I constantly am making ""not straight"" jokes. Make a crooked line when cutting wrapping paper? I've never done a straight thing in my life! That squiggly line is as straight as I am! Lol. There are so many good dad jokes). But yea. The most important thing is making your son feel accepted and loved. Best of luck to you!",533,0.29533462,0.554028314,4/17/25 6:57

I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äútreat him like your daughter,‚Äù so much as consider whether or not you would approve of/allow your daughter to date an older guy, an authority figure, or what have you, when those things come up, Don‚Äôt necessarily treat him like a girl, just think critically before you make these decisions or offer him advice. 

I would also have a conversation with him about wearing makeup and whatever. You could say something like, ‚ÄúI never want you to feel like you can‚Äôt be yourself, or express yourself the way you want to, because of me. I love you, and I will support you no matter how you dress and regardless of how you choose to present yourself.‚Äù

Now with regard to safety, I do think that is a valid concern. Someone just told me last week that she moved to a new state because where she was living, people were not accepting of her trans child, to the point that she was afraid for her child‚Äôs life. And that was more than three months ago.

I realize this is not an option for everyone, but if you think you could move to a more accepting community, I would definitely consider it. Whether you can or not, I think you can help members of your community be more open to LGBTQ+ people by always being an ally. If it were my kid, anytime they wanted to go to an event that celebrates LGBTQ+ people, I would be right there with them. You can lead by example. 

Along those lines, you may need to prepare yourself to cut some people out of your lives if they don‚Äôt accept your kid. You don‚Äôt have to do that right away and you don‚Äôt necessarily have to give ultimatums, but if someone expresses to you that they don‚Äôt accept your kid for who they are, you can say something like ‚Äúif that‚Äôs the case, then I need to re-evaluate our relationship, because I‚Äôm not sure how I can accept someone who doesn‚Äôt accept my kid.‚Äù And then you give it some thought and decide what is best for you and your child.

I hope this helps. Also Dan Savage writes a column that I believe is primarily about sex, but also discusses some things like when your teenage son starts dating men, just FYI.",4954,0.169645022,0.49192785,4/17/25 1:44
To All the Boys I‚Äôve Loved Before,AmIOverreacting,My son just told me he is gay. AIO?,"Man I was worried about how this post would go, I was NOT expecting to see an actual like, good response and was worried this would be like a ""how do i beat the gay outta my boy? Do i gotta use a female bat so he doesnt enjoy it?"" Or some weird shit like that. 

You had a perfectly reasonable reaction, you were shocked by the information, and you reassured him this wont change how you feel. Thats probably all he needs, you dont need to change or anything, just keep loving him like you do. To hell with what your country thinks. Unless its illegal there, then there could be issues, but it sounds like its just ""frowned upon"" so then fuck em.

For how you should act around SO's, yeah just treat them how you would anyone, be kind, dont pry on what they do behind closed doors, encouraged safe sex (incase you didnt know, yes its still risky if they have sex without condoms) but other than that, you really just need to be there for him, and show him his sexuality doesnt change anything between you both, but again based on your instinctual reaction, and even the fact you took the time to ask for help, I think you‚Äôll be fine, and you are doing a grear job as a Dad!",686,0.063815789,0.551315789,4/17/25 1:33

It sounds like you‚Äôre a really loving father, and that‚Äôs going to be the most important thing here. 

If there‚Äôs a moment that calls for it, you can always explain to him that you love him and 1000% support him. That you don‚Äôt WANT to say or do anything incorrectly, but that you‚Äôre still learning too.

Ma,abortion,MA experiences please,"So I want to chime in. I‚Äôm going through my first abortion and I took the pill route.

The doctor had me take a (forgot the name of the pill) it‚Äôs the one that stops the pregnancy from continuing to grow. I was fine afterwards.

And then roughly 24 hours later, she had me take I think the miso pills. I followed her instructions to put two in each cheek and let them just sort of sit and dissolve there for about 30 minutes before completely swallowing the pills with some water and swishing around to make sure that I got everything.

About an hour later, I started to bleed lightly. My cramping is pretty bad. I would say a 7 out of 10, but it‚Äôs off and on.

I definitely feel bloated but I had been anyways for weeks due to the pregnancy.

The bleeding is a lot lighter than I anticipated and I did pass a few clots earlier. The diarrhea is pretty bad surprisingly.

Mostly it‚Äôs the cramps that are bothering me and I‚Äôm typing this about five hours out from taking the pills.

I have a two week follow up appointment to make sure that there‚Äôs no more material left and that I passed everything.

I suppose it‚Äôs too early to say if it‚Äôll get worse or not? I definitely have anxiety around periods because mines were always really bad growing up. Compared to the worst bleeding episodes I‚Äôve ever had, this is nothing right now.

I have some trauma and fear but honestly, besides the cramps that are worse than usual, I feel OK.",2,-0.005753968,0.525727513,11/23/24 18:51

Ma,abortion,MA experiences please,"I had one maybe 5weeks 6days? I took the pills as directed, same day. Some hours apart, I don‚Äôt remember. I know that day I was completely out of it.

My heart didn‚Äôt want to but my head knew it was the right decision. Anyways, that could have played another factor into that but I was completely out of it for 2 days after the day I did it. I could barely stand, I couldn‚Äôt think or see straight, I was extremely weak. I couldn‚Äôt hold my arms up to do my job for more than a few minutes.

Eye for an Eye,NoStupidQuestions,Why is ‚ÄúAn eye for an eye‚Äù a poor philosophy?,"The standard reject is that ""an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind.""  It's a rejection of revenge for revenge's sake. But it's a misinterpretation of a Biblical passage. The usual interpretation is that you should punish an eye for the *worth* of an eye and a tooth for the *worth* of a tooth. In other words, punish in proportion to the crime, don't just, say, make every crime punishable by death, no matter how slight.",468,-0.030208333,0.257291667,2/17/23 12:09
Eye for an Eye,NoStupidQuestions,Why is ‚ÄúAn eye for an eye‚Äù a poor philosophy?,"If you always take an eye for an eye you can get into a cycle of violence that spirals out of control. Not only that, it might all start with a mistake, a perceived slight that wasn't intentional but was misinterpreted. And it may not be at all appropriate if you are in a civilized society dealing with friendly people.

An eye for an eye, or tit for tat as it's known in game theory, is not a bad philosophy for survival in a highly competitive situation, what you might call a dog-eat-dog world. In a dangerous environment, team up with like minded individuals who haven't done you any harm, and agree that if anyone attacks the community you all retaliate in kind. This can work.

But a better philosophy, even in aggressive competition, is tit for tat *plus forgiveness*. That doesn't mean forgiving everything, or even most things. But forgiving something every once in a while avoids those cycles of violence. 

Furthermore, in normal civilized society where the slights are minor -- for example, a friend who is often late -- it might be inappropriate to retaliate in kind. Maybe you still want to be friends and just plan for your friend to 10 minutes late rather than coming 20 minutes late to make him wait 10 minutes. That could quickly develop into each of you being ridiculously late unless you just overlook it in the first place.",102,0.103876812,0.610615942,2/17/23 12:17

But you do need to get on the same page as your wife. I take it that neither of you wear glasses. That prescription is small enough that he could get by without them BUT it will strain his eyes. They could get worse faster. He probably has a low grade headache if he leaves them off for more than a couple hours.¬†

That‚Äôs a near-sighted prescription, so he probably doesn‚Äôt need them to read a book, but it would help him see the white board at the front of his classroom. It‚Äôll help him track a baseball to catch.¬†

On the other hand, the prescription is big enough that he‚Äôd be required to wear them to drive a car.¬†

Hopefully your wife can understand the difference they‚Äôll make. If she is hesitating because it‚Äôs an inconvenience to her or she thinks he‚Äôll be teased, she needs to get over it.¬†

I also thought it has a nice positive vibe was also acknowledging the dark parts of Tim's life. The way Ash was portrayed was much better. He was always Tim's friend, not just his manager. True Stories made him out to be the villain, which he never was.

My critiques would be that post-True was a bit rushed. Another half hour or hour would've been great. I also think it could've used more interviews. I think True Stories did better post-True.

Overall, I preferred this to True Stories, I just wish it was longer so it could be a bit more in depth. With the narration, it really felt like the story Tim wanted to tell.",6,0.350662879,0.516382576,2/14/25 0:46

Non-Stop,mildlyinfuriating,My eyes been twitching non stop like this for 2 years,"So this happened to me for close to two years, and I tried everything to make it stop. I quit using caffeine, drinking alcohol, tried Tonic water, tried Magnesium, B6 and B12 tablets, muscle relaxers prescribed from a Neurologist, and finally, botox injections. I've seen 2 Neurologists, multiple eye doctors and GPs, and a ocular and orbital surgeon. 

They all told me conflicting information. One of them attributed it to Celiacs disease which I found out that I had from a blood test for it. One thinks I have a variant of blepharospasm, which is odd considering I'm only 32. Most doctors I saw attribute it to stress and fatigue.  

The botox did help but did not make it go away. Recently, I saw a neuro ophthalmologist, and he thinks it is caused by eye strain because I read things on my phone and work with computers all day. I have 20 20 vision and have no problem reading things close up but he said that even with that, my occular system was working overtime and after a certain point, you may have neurological reactions such as this. He prescribed me reading glasses, and I think that was the primary issue because it seems to be slowly improving.

All that being said, I'm not a doctor, and I'd take their advice before mine.  I understand how something like this uproots your life and is extremely debilitating in every way possible. I'm sorry it's happening to you, and I hope something here helps.",3441,0.001739927,0.613186813,3/9/25 17:44

Horizon: An American Saga: Chapter 1,movies,Official Discussion - Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter One [SPOILERS],"This movie won‚Äôt work for everyone, but it absolutely worked for me, I loved it! Sure it might‚Äôve been better as a tv show/mini series but I think the movie still did a good job in terms of getting us to connect with the different characters and the pacing was adequate. The 3 hours didn‚Äôt feel overbearingly long. This is only chapter 1 after all so it‚Äôs all a set up for the future movies.

Movie was a good mix of action, drama, and some surprising comedy. Also, what a stacked cast, my standouts probably have to be Luke Wilson and Jeff Fahey. 

Didn‚Äôt really need that trailer at the end but it did make me even more excited for chapter 2. Not sure how well this is gonna do at the box office, but I hope it does well enough for Kevin Costner to be able to complete this saga. 8/10 for me!",218,0.300416667,0.560555556,6/28/24 22:17

‚Ä¶but mannnn was this badly edited. There was literally no cohesion between storylines and a severe lack of glue to give any indication of where we were time wise or even character wise. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I always respect when a director stays away from obvious exposition. But this literally felt like a collection of many dragged out scenes with entirely new characters in each, and with sparse context provided for them.

I oscillated between being entertained (some scenes created tension superbly), bored (some scenes just felt extraneous and unnecessary), and confused (some scenes had characters and motivations that had me scratching my head).

I do think Furiosa herself was quite standout, along with Praetorian Jack (who unfortunately, didn't get nearly as much screen time as he deserved). Certain ""heavy"" movie scenes also touched me, though I felt they should've been more profound, probably by being more extended.

In the Heart of the Sea,movies,"""In the heart of the sea"" should have been good","Wow, not much love for this flick... personally I liked it, although I'd describe it more as an enjoyable popcorn movie than a life-changer.  A strength of the film is the CGI, which is really well-integrated with live action, and is shown to advantage on the big screen.  Yes, the story held few surprises, but I did find it entertaining, and some of the performances (Brendan Gleeson and Ben Whishaw) were quite good -- (though I did think Cillian Murphy was somewhat under-utilized).",38,0.240530303,0.483333333,12/26/15 11:34

My suggestion would be to take it slow and really try to take it all in, it's not a book you can plow through in a day. If you start it and don't like it, put it down. It might be a bit hard if you don't read very much. You might do well with some other 19th century literature first, Robert Louis Stevenson for example.",3,0.081269841,0.461825397,5/10/20 13:39

Armor,duneawakening,Stillsuit vs Armor,"For heavy armor, the heat protection is pretty abysmal, so you will need to carry additional water with you . BUT, heavy armor is great against ranged threats, which will save on your shield durability.

Light armor trades the catchpocket for better armor and stamina, with pretty alright heat protection (less than stillsuit). This is good armor for melee builds.

Stillsuits have best heat protection and catchpockets, so water is pretty much a non factor.

In Hagga Basin, there is enough water around to use whatever armor you like. In the Deep Desert, however, water is incredibly scarce (no dew, few enemies for blood). So water is a much more conscious decision late game.

Hope this helps.

EDIT: Personally, I use a unique stillsuit that adds increase armor, and wear light armor helmet,gloves, and boots. The unique stillsuit gives you armor equivalent to light, plus you still keep the catchpocket. I am a swordmaster/BG",8,0.237333333,0.588666667,6/13/25 12:09
Armor,duneawakening,Stillsuit vs Armor,"I use the still suit quite often, at least the chest/leg item.

Water to drink has never been an issue once im at the point of iron or better.

The 500ml i may or may not save when using/not a still suit is a drip compared to what I just need to craft.

like, 100 iron is 2500ml, then take that to steel and its another 5000ml.

Personal water usage is a drop in the bucket vs production water needs.  So use whatever you like, save a little water and have better heat, wear all heavy, light, mix and match.  From a purely water saving basis it really is moot, in my opinion.",6,0.125198413,0.455555556,6/13/25 11:44

Armor,duneawakening,Stillsuit vs Armor,"This was an issue I and many others brought up in the closed beta. Stillsuits become redundant and actually much less desirable an option the higher level you get, and as your literjon, dew reaper, etc technology gets better. Apparently the Plasteel one has better armor and some specials have better armor, but none of the one's below that are even close to worth using over other armors. Personally I think it's a poor decision and I wish there were at least better craftable options for better armored Stillsuits.",4,0.144270833,0.374479167,6/13/25 11:54
Armor,duneawakening,Stillsuit vs Armor,"I would stop using a stillsuit once you move North and west of the rift. Or at least parts of it. I am a bit cheap, so I use heavy chest and legs and kept the rest stillsuit. Works rather well, since I snipe and shotgun everything at range anyway. I have never had to use the water feature of the stillsuit and once you have the industrial scythe you don't really need to worry too much about water.

Finishing the Fremen trials is also a good idea, since it gives you the death still, which is like a juice press for people",3,0.166666667,0.433333333,6/13/25 11:48
Armor,duneawakening,Lets Talk Armor,"If you primarily use your gun and only use the knife as a last resort, you take less damage when shooting, so that's where I would use the heavy armor. Of course, you can argue that the shield basically negates gun damage, but as I said, that is only true when you are not using your guns. So, IMO, the heavy armor is viable, but it all depends on the playstyle.",3,0.022916667,0.535416667,6/13/25 3:01
Armor,duneawakening,Lets Talk Armor,">I personly dont see a point in Heavy armor at all

  
Tell me you are not end-game without telling me you are not at end-game.

The enemies will rip a new hole on your body if you wear a Light Armor, lol. Shield wont protect you, since if you shoot back, Shield is down... and enemies deal a LOT of damage.

Armor,duneawakening,Lets Talk Armor,"You don't actually take more melee damage, because you have more ALL resist from having literally double the raw armor value. Armor value gives you ALL RESIST, so you actually take LESS damage with heavy armor than light armor because the values are multiplicative anyways, not additive.  
So it's more like 1 - ((1-armorDR)\*(1-bladeDR).

So if you have light armor you'd have for example, With tier 5 light armor you have 786 Armor value. That would give you 61% All DR, Then you'd add the 32% from blade resistance which would total out to 73% Blade resist.

Heavy armor on the other hand of the same tier will have almost double the armor value, putting you at 1417 armor value, you'd have 73% ALL resist, meaning against bladed enemies you would take EXACTLY the same amount of damage, but against bullets you take less because of the heavy armor giving bullet resist.

Meaning light armor takes more damage against bullets, but both take the same against blades.",3,0.10670406,0.368536325,6/18/25 17:33

Sikandar,bollywood,Sikandar - Reviews and Discussions,"![gif](giphy|INl5mBnakr3R45BPgu)

Salman needs to take a break seriously. And then make a comeback with a soft lighthearted movie. This one is the cringiest Bhai movie ever. And not only him, from Rashmika to Sharman to Kajal, everyone performed badly! CGI is very noticeable, bad BGM music with a headache inducing rap song and pacing issue throughout the movie. Also Suneil Shetty isn't in the film.",33,-0.268055556,0.608333333,3/30/25 4:46
Sikandar,bollywood,Sikandar - Reviews and Discussions,"Just saw this movie this evening. My expectations were low. Salman Khan has been making bad movies for years and AR Murugadoss hasn't made a good movie in years (though Sarkar has its moments).  Both desperately needed a hit film. Sikandar isn't that film. 
The movie had some good, albeit dated ideas but the execution was questionable. I read that they were still shooting the movie well into March to reach an Eid release date. This film seemed rushed in some places, especially the VFX. The car explosion scene near the interval was laughably bad and unbecoming of such a big budget film. The lighting for some of the green screen scenes was way off. 

Salman looked disinterested in the movie and struggled to feign any enthusiasm. The movie seemed like a 2 and a half hour script reading; it felt like the actors were reading their lines for the first time.  The Chemistry between Rashmika and Salman was nil. She felt like Rajasaab's employee instead of  his spouse. If one told me that Sharman Joshi was Khan's love interest, I might have believed them. Veteran South Indian actor Satyaraj didn't have much to do in this movie as the villain. One of the weakest villains I have seen in some time. 

One thing that infuriates me about modern Bollywood is the emphasis of style over substance; that slick production can paper over a substandard script and lacklustre acting. AR Murugadoss had so much at stake with the film and completely failed with the script. The direction wasn't much better. He has a Tamil film, Madharasi coming out this year and he will be relegated to B and C grade movies if he doesn't deliver a hit. Perhaps his time has passed as a director.  

It seems like Salman Khan's post 60 career will mirror Dharmendra's with Khan starring in really bad mid to low budget films and wooing heroines in their 30s. He seems resistant to reinventing himself and really acts like he doesn't care. Perhaps he's going through the motions to fulfill perceived obligations to his fanbase, or actual obligations to his family as he appears to be bankrolling their lifestyle.  Salman needs to stay away from Eid releases so he doesn't spoil this holiday for people who want to enjoy a movie.",38,-0.012643678,0.409482759,3/31/25 1:38
Sikandar,bollywood,Sikandar - Reviews and Discussions,"The movie is terrible it's time for him to do age appropriate role First off, Salman‚Äôs been coasting on the same damn formula for years‚Äîbig action flicks, shirtless flexing, and that cocky smirk that used to make fans lose their minds. Back in the day, that vibe was fresh, and his energy was electric‚Äîlike, *Wanted* and *Dabangg* had us all hooked, right? But now? It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs stuck on repeat, and the playlist‚Äôs getting old as fuck. He‚Äôs not evolving, babe. The dude‚Äôs still trying to play the badass lover boy at 59, and it‚Äôs just not hitting the same. His films feel like they‚Äôre made for the 2010s crowd, not us Gen Z folks who want something with a little more bite.

And don‚Äôt get me started on his acting‚Äîor lack of it. The guy‚Äôs phoning it in harder than I do when my mom asks about my grades. You can see it in his eyes‚Äîhe looks tired, like he‚Äôd rather be anywhere else. Posts on X are even calling him out for lazy dialogue delivery and zero effort on screen. Shit, I‚Äôd be bored too if I had to punch the same goons and dance to recycled beats every year. Where‚Äôs the spark, the passion? He used to own that larger-than-life aura, but now it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs just going through the motions to cash a paycheck.

Then there‚Äôs Bigg Boss. Fuck, that‚Äôs a whole mess. Hosting it for months on end exposes him way too much‚Äîover half the year, he‚Äôs on TV or OTT, and not in a good way. People on X are saying it‚Äôs tanking his mystique. Back in the day, stars like him were rare sightings, which made them legends. Now? He‚Äôs yelling at contestants every weekend, and the negativity online just piles up. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs traded his Bollywood crown for a reality TV throne, and it‚Äôs not a good look, sweetheart.

Oh, and let‚Äôs talk about his posse. Word is, he‚Äôs surrounded by yes-men who are just milking his fading stardom. They‚Äôre picking shitty scripts and directors who don‚Äôt push him‚Äîprobably ‚Äòcause they know he won‚Äôt bother stepping up anyway. Kabir Khan dodged him for a reason, love; Salman‚Äôs a creativity vampire at this point. Every movie looks the same‚Äîsame backdrop, same predictable plot. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs allergic to taking risks.

Physically, he‚Äôs not keeping up either. Fans are clocking his ‚Äúpoor fitness‚Äù and ‚Äúmediocre looks‚Äù lately, and yeah, time catches us all, but he‚Äôs not even trying to adapt. Compare that to someone like Aamir, who reinvents himself, or even SRK, who‚Äôs still got that charm dialed up. Salman‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there, and it‚Äôs fucking sad.

Look, I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs done for good‚ÄîI‚Äôd never count out a guy with his legacy. But he needs to reignite that fire, like pre-COVID days when he owned the screen. Maybe ditch the entourage, pick a ballsy script, and show us he‚Äôs still got it. ‚ÄòCause right now, babe, he‚Äôs boring the shit outta me .",29,-0.070193452,0.522232143,3/30/25 3:36

Leave No Trace,TrueFilm,Has anyone here seen Leave No Trace(2018)? - Spoilers!,"Leave No Trace is my favorite film of 2018. I highly recommend seeing it in the theatre. I saw it at Cinema 21 in Portland, OR on a large screen and it was absolutely worth it.

It's a beautiful movie in every sense. The nature scenes are gorgeous. It's the only movie I've seen where every single character on screen means well.

I found the father cowardly and selfish but that doesn't mean I found massive amounts of compassion for him. Foster completely nails a quietly disturbed man. With a lesser actor it would be hammy. But it's *perfect*.

Thomasin came close to stealing the show. As soon as I left the theatre I told my girlfriend ""that movie wouldn't have worked nearly as well without her eyes"". They tell so much. She's a gifted actress.

The final scene made me silently cry in the theatre. Not usual crying, but a sort of happy cry? Just loads of emotion on screen.

The direction is understated and completely appropriate. Minimal music, no scenes or shots that draw attention to themselves. It's about the characters, and they shine.

I absolutely love this film, and I could talk about it for hours.",27,0.198716931,0.60569224,11/8/18 20:26

I know I'm not the first to say this, but what a joyous and *realistic* experience to watch a movie where people do the right thing. I don't know if I've ever seen a movie where every person is good in the way they are here. Not that I think people are basically good, but I think we can choose to be.

Just think of how a schlocky filmmaker might have felt the need to make the social workers non-understanding dicks, or make the 4-wheelers who she finds after her dad gets hurt pervy jerks, or whatever. Such a great choice and plays so effectively because it never tempts you to slide this film into an easy category.

If you like this, I *highly* recommend seeking out *The Rider* from earlier this year. It's only real similarities are the real-life pacing, brilliant performances and sense of people trying to do good, but both movies moved me like few films do.

The end made me cry, and I don't know how the filmmakers made that happen. The film felt so REAL, and I was completely taken in. Both Thomasin McKenzie and Ben Foster were superb.

Mark Kermode sums up my feelings better than I could: ""Granik here conjures a low-key drama about cultural and generational divides that is alternately gripping and melancholic, but always shot through with the unmistakable ring of truth. The result is work of overwhelming, understated power that quite simply took my breath away.""

Paycheck,TooAfraidToAsk,"What do Americans mean when they say they live ""paycheck to paycheck"" ?",It usually means there's no or hardly any money left once they buy essential stuff for luxuries or to save. Basically their bank account is at 0 when the next check comes,3042,-0.108333333,0.218333333,1/26/25 2:17
Paycheck,TooAfraidToAsk,"What do Americans mean when they say they live ""paycheck to paycheck"" ?","First, ""paycheck to paycheck"" means that if anything ever happened to disrupt that paycheck, you would pretty much immediately be in financial trouble. For many Americans, if we lost out on just 1 paycheck, we'd struggle to pay bills, get food, and could even find ourselves homeless. Paycheck to paycheck isn't about being rich or poor, it's about your budget. You can be upper middle class, making 200k/yr and still be paycheck to paycheck if you're carrying major expenses.

Second, remember price tags for many goods stay basically the same regardless of the local cost of living. An iPhone is going to cost about 1k in San Francisco (a very wealthy city) and in Memphis (a very poor city). A Toyota Corolla is going to cost about 25k in both San Francisco and Memphis. The person making minimum wage in San Fran ($18/hr) is going to have a much easier time making these purchases than the guy making minimum wage in Memphis ($7.25/hr). Now I didn't want to haphazardly throw out international cities at risk of saying something completely wrong, but the point carries globally. The iPhone is 3 or 4 months of your salary, I get paid an iPhone in 1.5 weeks and I'm just an unskilled warehouse worker. The goods that carry stable price tags are easy to get.

However, the goods that change a lot by locality is where it really gets us. Have you looked at home prices? Even in Memphis, the cheapest rent you'll realistically find is about 650 and that's for a shitty studio apartment. That minimum wage of 7.25 with full time hours is only gonna get you $1160 in a month, and that's before taxes. Actual take home pay is probably closer to 1000. That's 65% of your income gone! In San Francisco, you'd have a hard time finding any studios under 1200 and even those are hard to come by. With our minimum wage full-time worker making about 3k/mo gross (around 2700 after taxes), that's a good chunk of their paycheck gone, just keeping a roof over their heads. This problem comes up with many other goods too. For instance, utilities, internet, gas, insurance, etc. are all bills that can be a lot higher in some places than others. I rent my home for 965/mo, and with a recent cold snap, I just used $450 of electricity last month. Half my freaking rent! Half of that iPhone! Gone! And I'm in a lower cost of living city! I'm just saying we might start the month with more money than you but it goes fast. It's true that we live our lives with more luxuries like AC and phones but that doesn't mean our budgets aren't tight. 

Another important factor is we can only go so cheap. For instance with houses, we have a lot of regulations like that homes must be a minimum size, that they must be built of certain materials, that they must include certain amenities, etc. These make it so that even if I'm willing to live in a 100sq ft shack, I'm not allowed to. Even if I'm willing to live with no electricity, I'm not allowed to. Even if I'm willing to live with dirt floors, I'm not allowed to. Even if I'm willing to share my bedroom with 3 other people, I'm not allowed to. This problem repeats elsewhere. For instance, all cars built after 2018 are required to have backup cameras which is great for safety but sucks for the guy on a tight budget. We're required to have health insurance, car insurance if you drive, home insurance if you own your house which is all great in theory except it sucks for the guy on a super tight budget. I don't know if it's accurate but I've seen a lot of videos of people building or manufacturing stuff walking around barefoot or just with flip flops on and that wouldn't fly at all here. At minimum those jobs would require closed-toed shoes, many of them would require steel toe boots and you wouldn't be allowed to work without them which is great for safety but sucks for the guy on a super tight budget. Our food, cars, clothes, toys, tools, roads, worksites, basically everything have regulations attached which do improve our quality of life but also add expense to our life. In other words, we're required by law to live luxuriously (at least relative to the poorest of countries), but we still have to pay for those luxuries.",644,0.111652774,0.485511294,1/26/25 4:08
Paycheck,TooAfraidToAsk,"What do Americans mean when they say they live ""paycheck to paycheck"" ?","Things are very different here.  Cell phones, internet,  computers and cars are actually necessities here.  Our cities are not built for walking and there is little to no public transportation,  so you have to drive to get anywhere.  It's not strange to have to travel more than 6 kilometers to get to a grocery store.  Average commute time to work one-way is 26 minutes, so if we assume an average of 45 miles per hour, that work out to around 35 km to go one way.

There are no payphones or landlines anymore, and a smartphone is a necessity if you don't have a computer.  We have to apply for jobs on the internet and gather information on the internet.   We do not have social networks here, so there's no family around to ask for help or knowledge.

Traveling ""abroad"" is not hard to do here.  The majority of Americans live extremely close to the border of Canada or Mexico.  Americans rarely travel outside of North America unless they are associated with the military.

We do eat out quite often.  We work some of the longest hours in the developed world, and households typically require two earners to survive.  There is no family to help out, so time spent cooking meals is often seen as a waste.  My neighbor has 2 kids.  She wakes up at 5am, leaves the house at 6:30am to drop her kids at daycare, 20 minutes to daycare, 10 minutes to get the kids inside, she heads to work at 7am and arrives around 7:40am.  She's settled at her desk for 8am, works until usually 5:30 or 6pm and eats at her desk while working.  Picks up her kids around 6:30pm, and arrives home at 7pm.  She has to do chores, wash clothes, make sure homework is done, etc, and get the kids ready for bed.  Cooking takes around an hour, and she's lucky if she can get to bed by 10:30pm.  She does this all herself,  and she's utterly exhausted, and frankly, she looks like hell.   Her husband works 12 hour shifts with an hour commute each way, so he's not really able to help much.  This is not abnormal here.

Generally,  Americans do have a significant spending problem -- we plan to cook meals, but we're so exhausted at the end of the day that half the food is wasted and goes bad.  We have standards that have to be met with our appearance if we want to keep our jobs, so we tend to buy clothing more often as there's really no good excuse here to wear something with a stain or hole on it to work.  There is a fair bit of waste with name brand clothing and other items, as the pressure to look like you're better off than you actually are is intense.

Homeownership is becoming less accessible to Americans.  Right now, for many (myself included), it took two dead parents to have enough for a down payment.   I'd rather have my dad and my mother in law than this house, but their deaths were the only reason we could do a down payment.  

What it boils down to is that developing nations are living on a totally different plane of existence than places like the US.  We can't even begin to compare, because there is no comparison.  One of my very good friends is Thai.  Her family back home assumes she's rich and can send loads of money all the time, but they have no idea how tight the budget is.  She has had to take of two part-time jobs in addition to her full time job so she can send money home to her parents.  The average American could not manage a single month without income, and the loss of a job is absolutely catastrophic, even in a two-income household.  I've lived in multiple countries, and there's absolutely no fair comparison between the two because we're just so very different.",668,0.036775558,0.448301587,1/26/25 3:01
Paycheck,TooAfraidToAsk,"What do Americans mean when they say they live ""paycheck to paycheck"" ?","I think it's really important to remember that not everyone in America is living the same life.

The people who have all those nice things you list are not necessarily the same people that say they're living paycheck to paycheck. there is of course a middle group of people who live beyond their means, but a growing number of Americans do not earn enough to feed themselves properly for the whole month. These people are not eating out every week or owning houses.

As you can see before, it was difficult and loud and you could see me breathe. After, easy, pretty quiet, and no nostril moving!! 

Just to be clear, I got air only through the left side of my nose and then very little. My nostrils completely collapsed with every breath. I got enough to not know something was weird but not enough to ever independently breathe through my nose.

To answer the most common questions:

I had a septoplasty, turbinate reduction and expansion, balloon sinuplasty, air pockets removed, and tubes placed. 

I saw 4 ENTs in my life about the side effects but this was the first to do a CT and see I have a 90% blockage and my problems came from too little air. It was covered by insurance. 

I am aware that your nose is for breathing, many of you took this too literally. I had a 90% blockage so air came in, I could smell, etc. But it was a chore and I didn't get enough air to breathe only through my nose. If you've had something some way for your entire life you would never think to question it. 

I could smell but now I've learned not well. My voice did not change. Food has a sharper taste. 

Recovery was rough but manageable when following the instructions the doc gave me. 

A lot of people have diminished breathing through their nose and don't know it. Maybe ask someone around you what their experience is and see if you need the same as me.

Hemp and jute were two of the best materials, with hemp being easily grown in the US and a few areas of Europe. The US (particularly Kentucky) was to hemp production what Saudi Arabia is to oil.

He could have an unrelated standard that wasn't being met, and a therefore price hike was attached (For example, influence on the script and editing).

The Expendables 4,todayilearned,"TIL Bruce Willis dropped out of the Expendables 3 because he wanted 4 million dollars instead of 3 million, for four days of work.","The way I've heard it is this; Willis doesn't want to do action movies anymore, so he puts up a ridiculously high price to be involved in them and if that price is met he does it for the paycheck. What he'd rather do is the kind of work Harvey Keitel is known to do, take roles for small films for hardly any money (comparatively) and use his starpower to give the movie the boost it needs. 

Kevin Smith and Rian Johnson had an interesting conversation about it, because Smith has notoriously talked about how awful it was to work with Willis on Cop Out while Johnson had nothing but good things to say about him working on Looper. From the way they talked about it, you could come to the conclusion that Willis doesn't have too much respect for directors who don't write the scripts for their movies and is only doing big studio films for the paycheck. When he worked with Kevin Smith he refused to do more than one take, wouldn't change his delivery, would leave set early, insulted Smith on not knowing the technical details of the lenses they were filming with, etc. While on Looper, he worked with Johnson for little pay and was happy to be collaborative with Johnson on whatever he wanted. 

It certainly is an interesting case, and if it's true I don't begrudge the guy for charging what he does for the work he does. He knows as a brand name he can sell a movie and if he gets the money he's asking  for he'll show up and phone in a performance.

She's such a pulverizing card too. Like the moment she gets deployed, the entire remainder of the match is just strategizing to counter her. It's the same problem I have with MK and Prince.

The Diplomat,bollywood,The Diplomat - Reviews and Discussions,"We keep cribbing how Bollywood is churning boring movies with nepodis and nepodas. How South movies have better scripts etc. How we are taken for granted for Bollywood.

Now here is a movie - The Diplomat -  that has done a highly sincere job to give to you a story of courage and perseverance - a real life at that. With a caste that has peformed brilliantly to literally keep you at the edge of your seat for the whole film. 

And here we are. Not watching it in theatres means we are not going to encourage good quality content.

Aren't you all sick of all the glossy promotions that happen these days around movies? Heres one which is a dark horse, no unnecessary hype ..bas a movie made with keeping quality cinema in mind. 

Dekho yaar .. we need to break out of mediocrity.. 200 rs ki coffee mat peena ek din! Warna Naadiyan jaisi picturein dekhni padegi... soch lo !

The Diplomat,bollywood,The Diplomat - Reviews and Discussions,"The Diplomat is a no nonsense political thriller that perfectly demonstrates how to keep the audience (At least those who turn up for the movie) hooked to the screen with a tense story and crisp screenplay supported very well with honest performances by talented actors. 

John Abraham does a pretty good job as the titular smart and decisive Indian diplomat, even though his built perhaps makes him look a bit out of place as the calm protagonist. Sadia Khateeb is exceptional as the Indian woman tricked into an unwilling and abusive marriage in Pakistan. She balances the fragility and strength of her character very well and gives a great performance. Kumud Mishra, Sharib Hashmi and even the antagonists portrayed by Ashwath Bhatt and Jagjeet Sandhu do a justice to their respective roles. Revathy is good in her small but impactful role.

Shivam Nair truly delivers a cracker of a political thriller after directing tense spy thrillers like Naam Shabana, Special Ops and Mukhbir. The Diplomat is definitely close to the quality and thrills of his earlier work and a step up as far as his previous silver screen outings are concerned. Many may wait for the movie to land on OTT in a couple of month's time but if we want more cinema of this level of quality and genre then we should support it more in theater. Hopefully its target audience will not betray it at the box office. A top notch solid thriller. 8/10",21,0.25015361,0.52250384,3/15/25 22:58

Why do I like this show?  Older crowd, odd couple and high drama.  Actors and the personalities of their characters are likable, to me.  Sets, wardrobe, color grading, all good.

The CIA field director is shown as weak with Katie as well.  It doesn't make sense and feels weird to me.

Bad Influence,netflix,Bad Influence - $300K to 500K+ a month for years ???? where is all the money ????,There was a comment from one of the kids that I thought was interesting. He said Piper was often worried about money and mentioned that they needed to pay their mortgage. If they were making $6M a year she shouldn't have been worried about how they were going to pay their mortgage. So I think there are two possibilities. Either they weren't making as much money as people think or Tiffany lied to Piper about how they needed money to pressure her into working all the time. I'm not sure how Netflix verified that they were making $6M a year. Youtube is very lucrative but Piper didn't have one of the most popular channels for kids. That would be the Labrant kids or similar channels.,75,0.25,0.526984127,4/13/25 16:08

The Hill,telepathytapes,"Vulnerable Post, I Need Guidance, ""Talk On The Hill""","Hi OP - I am the mom of a semi-verbal autistic kid and very much resonate with your account here. Your nephew is very lucky to have an open minded empathetic auntie in his corner. I am also a mod of r/gatewaytapes and this may be the tool to help you. Remember everything in this universe works with intention and belief. The fact that you are acting out of selflessness for this child also helps. 

Here is the [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/s/p1IAiw8CUN) post for r/gatewaytapes which explains what it is. People frequently think it‚Äôs only about out of body states but it‚Äôs more like a complete system to understanding the universe through guided meditations and your own experiences. Because you‚Äôre already sensitive and open to this all it may be easier for you. 

The hill seems to be a frequency and there seems to be MANY ‚Äúhills‚Äù. It‚Äôs possible for you to even connect directly through telepathic communication with him. 

I have had a lifetime of strangeness myself and also with my child. Things that cannot be easily explained. I‚Äôm also starting out on this path and if it‚Äôs meant to be it‚Äôs meant to be. The community on r/gatewaytapes has indicated that the deeper focus (meditation) levels are a way to get to the Hill.

This is just my opinion based on 1 viewing

This film wants to be way smarter than it is  I understand all the metaphor of lycanthropy for shitty abusive behavior but it is handled so poorly   It almost seemed to me that they wanted to make a straightforward werewolf flick and got 3/4 of the way in and realized they basically had such a weak story that they decided to throw in the ‚Äútwist‚Äù of the domestic abuse   I think they originally wanted to show that the ‚Äúbeast‚Äù was bleeding over into the man‚Äôs normal times and causing him to be abusive and mercurial but that concept was weak and disjointed so they tacked on the ‚Äúoh he wasn‚Äôt really a werewolf after all‚Äù

130 IQ take - the werewolf is a metaphor for domestic violence¬†¬†¬† ¬†


200+ IQ take - the werewolf is real and Willow seeing her father at the end is the REAL metaphor.¬†


He IS a werewolf. He's also a possessive¬† asshole, yes, bus that's mostly born from his insecurities of being a werewolf. He's gotta know it's a matter of time before Imogen gets tired of the wolf shit and leaves him for another man, probably taking his daughter as well.¬†


Willow sees him as her father at the climax because she is finally accepting the fact that she is the same as him, and will become the beast one day as well, and like or not, he is her father and the only one who could truly understand. She sees past the wolf, and sees the real man inside.¬†


Imogen can never see him as anything but the werewolf, because not only does she not love him in the werewolf form, but she also doesn't have the affliction within her, so she'll never truly understand. Thats why he strikes her down at the climax. He knows she is imagining his human form while she hugs the him as a werewolf,¬† but he wants her to love the werewolf as well. It's also heavily implied that Imogen does not return the ""nothing changes"" phrase that night, which is why he busts out of the cage. He knows she's had enough and will leave him, so he better come get his daughter and take her away.


This is why, when Imogen holds her hand out to Willow for them to leave, Willow does not return the gesture, implying she wants to stay. She KNOWS that she will become the beast someday and must stay isolated at the farm.",19,0.056565657,0.45290404,10/27/24 21:36

The Beast Within,movies,A theory I haven't seen touched yet? The Beast Within (2024) ,"The surface story is a werewolf story. That's what it is because there's no other way to explain the werewolfy rituals the family goes about during the runtime. General rule of thumb is that if a theory leaves a plothole, or many, it's not correct.


That being said I think the ending ""twist"" is the girl realizing she's got the same monster in her as he father did. We see the father have an outburst of anger in the jeep after sniffing the girls dress. I think this is meant to show that he recognizes she's going to be like him and it obviously upsets him. This also explains, I think, why she sees him as human in the final scene. She is like him. And what's more is that she understands him. And he understands her (hello my little monster).


This also works on the subtext of this film analyzing domestic abuse through the eyes of a child as a lot dv perpetrators come from dv households. It's a cyclical trauma that repeats generation after generation, much like the curse of a werewolf.


Just my two cents anyway.",15,0.035416667,0.383333333,8/21/24 0:15

The Beast Within,movies,Beast Within 2024 - confusion,"Noah‚Äôs confinement in a castle every full moon can be interpreted through the lens of mental illness. His condition might be indicative of a disorder such as ‚Äúclinical lycanthropy,‚Äù where a person believes they can transform into a wolf or other animal.

Noah‚Äôs story about his grandfather could suggest a genetic predisposition to this disorder, or it could illustrate how generational trauma perpetuates the belief in lycanthropy among vulnerable mentally ill individuals. This pattern might also be reflected in Willow, who increasingly shows symptoms of psychosis, including dreams, visions, and voices. At one point, her father acknowledges her as ‚Äúprincess‚Äù, descendant to his ‚Äúkingdom‚Äù, as well as refers to her as his ‚Äúlittle monster‚Äù‚Äîperhaps clues to her own predisposition and further foreshadowing of her own future.

It is interesting her mother is never brought up or addressed.

The Beast Within,movies,Beast Within 2024 - confusion,"I know this post is around 8 months old, but thought I'd share my opinion based on my own experience of childhood trauma. (I won't be trauma dumping.)

Edit was to bold a sentence that addresses the thing you found most confusing, so it's easier to find.

So, you have the father telling the story of his father and grandfather. With childhood trauma it's common to have symbolic memories. Basically your mind filters what is confusing and unacceptable into something that makes more sense to a child. So she is filtering the story her father tells to make it more palatable (adds the werewolf aspect). Also the part about women falling for the men in the family is a direct correlation with the false charm of psychopaths.

It's not unusual for abusive people to turn it back on you. For example my father would say I was bad and didn't deserve love, and make me repeat it. Sometimes the victim believes these lies. Hence him calling her ""little monster"", and her ""visions"" that address her fears, including the fear she will become like her father because of the narrative he gives of generational trauma, and the way he uses it as an excuse for what he does.

Now, specifically the going out in the evening with a pig...I would like to suggest this is either an arrangement agreed upon between the parents to satisfy his sadistic, psychopathic nature where they go out there for him to torture the pig to death. OR the ***mother*** is the ""pig"", and the father takes her out there to hide the cruelty he's inflicting from the daughter. Remember, he says something about keeping it secret being painful. OR possibly both of those are true. **The ""cutting it close"" comment is probably just part of the symbolism the girl has created, rather than being something that was actually said.**

Also some of her ""visions"" will be symbolic PTSD flashbacks, again to make the memories easier to handle.

Hopefully that gives you, or anyone else who finds this in the future, some clarity! üôÇ",5,-0.025166667,0.516333333,5/9/25 17:41
The Beast Within,movies,Beast Within 2024 - confusion,"The movie is on Netflix in some countries now,  so you may have more conversation happening here.

I thought that the monster story was something the girl made up to do deal with seeing her father violent because he transforms into something else. She may have used the werewolf as a comparison because that's something she knew of.

When we are first introduced to him, the father is writhing in the bed and yells at the daughter when she touches him. I can't remember if that was her dream. In that scene he looks and acts like an addict going through withdrawal.

Later when they show his temper and violent side it made me wonder if the castle is symbolic of the mother trying to help him but ultimately becoming the punching back or sacrifice to save the girl from harm. Maybe the line about cutting it close is how close he came to killing her because we see the bruises on her body and her trouble bending, etc. 

There was also suggestion that the mother didn't trust her father and she felt safer with her husband the monster. Maybe her father was also abusive but in a different way, and her husband rescued her from that only to turn into a monster later. I think they would have done better with a different monster one that's more unpredictable or a Jekyll/Hyde scenario. 

It made me wonder if the father had mental health issues and was self medicating with alcohol or drugs, and him going off to a castle regularly was him trying to overcome the curse of addiction and ultimately becoming the monster repeatedly or like clock work because it was something he couldn't beat.",2,-0.000877193,0.532118758,5/10/25 8:07
The Beast Within,movies,Beast Within 2024 - confusion,"And the mother is also trapped in this cycle of abuse, she believes she has to stay with him because he is the father of her child and also because she's terrified of him, he isolated them, makes sure he scares them into not leaving him, he's possessive of them, thats how abusive people are. The grandfather is a witness to it all, like many family members that can't do anything to help. He's only allowed there by the father as long as he doesn't interfere, so he'd rather be there instead of leaving his daughter and granddaughter alone with the abuser. I also believe it's actually the wife that is being beaten, not him actually killing the pig, they may not actually go far away to hide the abuse, just where she can't see. But I like what someone else commented, that he actually believes he is a werewolf, it's a way for him to not take any responsibility for his actions, it could be mental illness, but it reminds me of a narcissist, they are experts at blaming everyone and everything for what they do...he could actually believe it meaning it's psychosis or he could of brainwashed his wife and daughter into believing it's true.

The Beast Within,teentitans,Are you mad about what Robin did to Beast Boy in The Beast Within?,"I could sort of see the reason why Robin reacted that way due to not only Beast Boy being influenced by the mutagenic chemicals, but he has an unconscious teammate (Raven) in his teeth and that same teammate he had tension with, which resulted in them fighting which made Robin assumed that Beast Boy hurt her and unfortunately Adonis was not there during that time and the Titans only saw both Beast Boy and Raven and they not have enough evidence to know it was not him.

As a detective, Robin should have noticed that Beast Boy's behaviour changes after he was exposed to the mutagenic chemicals. I would honestly say Robin was a bit too harsh on him, especially when Beast Boy said he does not remember after he transformed into the werebeast. 

Unfortunately, none of them noticed that Beast Boy, in his werebeast form, gently put Raven down on the floor. Cyborg mentions that Beast Boy's DNA has always been unstable and may finally be deteriorating, and all Beast Boy could think about was Raven and her state. I remember when Beast Boy, as the Werebeast escaped and was in the city, Cyborg managed to confront the beast, and it seemed that Beast Boy was still in there until Robin who was riding his motorcycle showed up I remember him ordering his teammates to take him down perceiving him more as a threat and also shooting him with launchers which made Raven wake up. It was unfortunate that Raven was not awake and that her body was too busy healing herself to explain her side of the story.

I have a theory that the reason why Robin reacted that way to him was because of Terra ever since she was working for Slade on the inside, and they were all defeated by using their vulnerabilities. It probably gave Robin some trust issues, and he would even put aside friendship if a teammate either betrayed or hurt another teammate, which would be ironic since he did work for Slade, but the difference between him and Terra was that he was blackmailed by him.

I wondered if Robin ever apologised to Beast Boy because out of all the Titans, in my opinion, I would say he sort of treated Beast Boy lesser than the other Titans. It would be interesting how Raven would react to all of this.",20,-0.007671958,0.669179894,3/26/25 16:05

Missing,AskReddit,"[Serious] People who went missing, what happened?","So, back when I was in Boy Scouts, my troop lost me.  Twice.  In the same night.  While I was *still in my tent*.  This is not an exaggeration.

The story is thus:  we were at Camp Decorah, in Iowa.  We had the idea to go and perform a raid on the counselor's tents/cabins.  I, however, was feeling ill, so I specifically said ""I'm not feeling well, I'm going to sleep.""  They acknowledged this, expressed regret that I was not coming along, and went to have their fun.

They have their fun.  They retreat into the woodline.  Then they take a headcount.  I am not in the headcount.  They expect me to be in the headcount, because they forgot.  So, now, there is a missing camper.  The entire camp is set to searching for me.  Some time during this, a guy from my troop decides to, get this, *check the tents*.  I am in my tent, as I should be.  So he goes to report that I am found.  I go to the bathroom during this time.  Someone comes back to the camp, and checks my tent.  I am in the bathroom, so I am not in my tent.  I am now *missing again*.

I get found sooner this time.

Edit:  You Iowa people:  I live in MN, just north of Decorah.  It's like 45 minutes away.

Missing,AskReddit,"[Serious] People who went missing, what happened?","When I was 4 I got lost in a city and was rescued by what my dad thought was a gang.  We had dinner in Chinatown with another family. 5 kids in all. Crossing the street after dinner, we were holding hands in a big chain. My older sibling let go. When the light changed and everyone crossed I stayed on the sidewalk - I was looking through a window into a barber shop where some huge guy was having his head shaved - can still picture the scene. When I finally looked around everyone was gone. I started to cry. A group of teenagers approached and asked if I was lost. I said yes. A tall kid hoisted me into his shoulders and started down the block. Other kids split up and went in different directions. We rounded a corner and I saw my dad. He turned white and ran toward us. The kid lowered me to the ground. A few other kids were there. They stood around awkwardly while the tall kid explained what happened to my dad. My dad (not a demonstrative guy) flung himself at the kid and hugged him. My mom appeared and picked me up. Years later my dad told me he saw the same group of kids hanging around when he first parked in the city that evening and was suspicious that they were a gang. He was embarrassed and tried to be less judgmental after that. Wish I could thank those guys. This was a long time ago. ",4841,-0.012091503,0.393954248,12/12/14 7:09

I was doing laundry one Sunday night while waiting to start extra cleaning duty, I woke up 12 days later to my supervisor shaking me awake in my dorm room. No one saw me for those 12 days, no one heard from me. I was not a recluse, I was extremely outgoing and easily noticed. How I vanished for 12 days is amazing.

**editing this to not have to reply to everyone: I was considered AWOL, got an Article 15 out of it.

Missing,AskReddit,What is the creepiest missing person case you know about?,"One of the most chilling ones is Nathaniel Bar-Jonah. He was a convicted paedophile and suspected serial killer/cannibal. He frequently impersonated police officers and attempted to lure children away from their homes. He was eventually arrested, but a judge ruled that the state had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah posed a public threat, so he was released, despite having told psychiatrists that he had a fascination of cannibalism.

Not long after his release, a ten-year-old boy was reported missing. Witnesses claimed that they had seen him in an alleyway, waiting for somebody. Another witness saw him being followed by an obese man matching Bar-Jonah's description, and the boy was distressed. The boy disappeared somewhere in that alleyway and was never seen again.

When the police searched Bar-Jonah's apartment, they found a list of names. The list included the names of his previous victims, as well as the missing boy followed by 'DIED'. They also found newspaper clippings regarding the case all over his apartment. A former flat mate of Bar-Jonah's reportedly found clothes in the apartment which matched the ones the missing boy was wearing on the day he went missing.

A notebook was also discovered with coded writing. It took months for the police and FBI to crack the code, but eventually they managed it. Bar-Jonah had written in-depth descriptions of cannibalism, as well as cooking recipes involving the body parts of children. The recipe titles included 'Little boy pot pie' and 'Roasted child.'

Despite weighing over 300lbs and known to have a large appetite, police found that he had not made any significant food purchases for almost a month after the missing boy's disappearance. During this time, he frequently held barbecues for his neighbours, who mentioned frequently that the meat he was serving tasted strange. Police later found a meat grinder in his apartment, which contained human DNA.

The police were never able to connected Bar-Jonah to the missing boy, and they never found the identity of the DNA from the meat grinder.

**EDIT: Due to the amount of people who've expressed interest, I'm including some extra details/clarification:**

The authorities in Montana, where the kidnapping occurred, weren't aware of his previous convictions which took place in Massachusetts. He had divulged some of his crimes to his probation officer, so the probation officer made a request to have his records sent through, but the records were never actually sent. 

**Cannibalism:**

He'd shown cannibalistic tendencies from the age of six. Teachers would frequently call his mother to notify her that Bar-Jonah was upsetting staff and students by eating his scabs and sucking his own blood. Whilst in prison, guards also observed this, as well as reporting that he appeared to be achieving sexual pleasure from it. 

**Lack of grocery purchases:**

He had purchased small items of food (ingredients for baking, for instance), but no meat or substantial food. 

**Early kidnappings/assaults:**

It's probably worth mentioning that Bar-Jonah began this (attempted) killing spree when he was seven years old. He lured a five-year-old girl into his basement, attempted to strangle her, but was stopped by the girl's mother when she heard the screams. When he was thirteen, he tried the same thing with a six-year-old boy, sexually assaulting him. He tried it once again a few years later with two boys, intending to kill them, but the boys wouldn't follow him. 

His next documented assault and attempted murder occurred when he was eighteen, and was believed to be the first time he impersonated a law official in order to assault a child. The child was found in the car with Bar-Jonah, covered in blood and his own excrement, nearly dead. He impersonated law officials several times in his life and was eventually (at age twenty) arrested and charged with attempted murder, receiving the maximum sentence.

**Arrest and imprisonment:**

During his time in prison, he changed his name from David Paul Brown to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah so that he could understand what it was like to be subjected to antisemitism. He acknowledged this in an interview with Dr. Michael Stone for 'Most Evil'. It was in this year that the judge ruled that the state had not provided enough evidence to prove that Bar-Jonah was still dangerous, leading to his release. 

**Sitting on a young child:**

A month after his release from prison (aged thirty-four and already morbidly obese), Bar-Jonah saw a seven-year-old boy sitting in a car alone. He entered the car and sat on the boy, until witnesses and the boy's mother saw what was happening and and ran over, prompting Bar-Jonah to flee the car. A police officer recognised the witness' description as Bar-Jonah and arrested him. Bar-Jonah first claimed that he had been attempting to get out of the rain, but later admitted that he had been trying to kill the boy. He was sentenced to probation.

**Zach Ramsay's disappearance:**

Police made the arrest when Bar-Jonah was found near a school, dressed as a law official and carrying a stun gun and pepper spray. 

Bar-Jonah was supposed to be tried for the murder and cannibalism of Zach Ramsay, but the child's mother would not cooperative with police, believing that her son was still alive. 

It is believed that Bar-Jonah may have first attempted to run the boy over in his car, as witnesses describe seeing a white car come close to hitting the boy. It was later confirmed that Bar-Jonah had access to his mother's car, which matched the description of the vehicle. 

At around the same time as the boy's disappearance, Bar-Jonah had been seen standing by a dumpster/skip wearing a police uniform, matching the pattern of police impersonation from his previous kidnappings, in the same alleyway. 

Whilst conducting the investigations into Zack Ramsay's disappearance, the detectives also found the word 'Tita' in Bar-Jonah's garage. This is assumed to have been a misspelling of 'Teta', the surname of another boy who had been kidnapped thirteen years prior (Bar-Jonah would have been sixteen). The boy had later been found dead, having been strangled and sexually assaulted. Huge lists of names were found written down - it is suggested that this may have been a list of his victims. 

After all of this, Bar-Jonah was eventually arrested for impersonation of a law official. However, after detectives found pictures of children and a bone belonging to a boy, he was charged with kidnapping and sexual assault. He was also charged with torture. Many of his crimes occurred after the statute of limitations had expired. ",600,0.030155974,0.32767306,7/24/17 6:49

Many parts of life are designed for stationary people. Car registration; health services; prescription pickup; veterinary care; ordering things online -- these all are designed for stationary people and are annoying to deal with on the road. For example, almost every grocery trip will be to a new store whose layout you aren't familiar with.

RV,RVLiving,The harsh reality of RV Living,"We've been sorta thrown into RV life for the last two weeks, with no prior experience. We're wildfire evacuees that bought a class A and left the next day lol, with zero time to prep.

Some comments/observations:

* There are way more RV life type of accommodations than I ever noticed. Dump stations are everywhere. Big rig parking is everywhere. Wifi is easier than expected. There is a huge community around this and people know how to live comfortably on the road, no doubt. Pilot Flying J, I love you.
* That being said, all of this crowd sourced knowledge could be improved upon. The community is largely retirement aged people. They know all the stuff and are incredibly helpful!!! But they don't use the internet as much, so the best info around wifi, campgrounds etc isn't crowd sourced nor validated often. Asking around and doing things in person is how a lot of these people operate, campgrounds included.
* Rig discrimination is very real in and out of parks. You can be turned away from certain RV resorts, so be sure to call and ask (same with breed restrictions if you have dogs)
   * never trust the info on the site. Call ahead. Nothing worse than being turned around and needing a new place to sleep, because they don't like your dog or rig
   * Keep your rig looking nice. It sucks but you will be immediately categorized as either:
      * on the road because they have money to travel and are enjoying life
      * homeless, not on the road by choice
      * You want people to assume you're in the first category, they will treat you different
      * Being relatively young and having a pitbull doesn't help this, so it is a little work to demonstrate to other older RVers that we're sane adults choosing the lifestyle, not tweakers.
* Things break. People are used to it, no reason to get mad. Nothing is very expensive, nor is it designed in a way that it can't be replaced. Just know how to turn off your power and water quickly
* Keep backups. I have no clue what I'm doing, I've drained the batteries so many times by accident at this point. But my generator or coach engine can always bring everything back to life.
   * point being - test switches, make mistakes, leave things on, but always have a way to get power back in your house batteries
* Sewer and grey water - honestly not as bad as I thought. Our toilet seals, there is no smell. We're finding 3 days of boondocking gives us plenty of tank space and no smell. Get a threaded dump adapter, flush a bunch, and it's fine
* be handy and know the systems are closed and simple.
   * By this I mean that it may feel like a lot of moving parts, and it is, but each individual thing on the rig is simple, and is designed to be used without force or any discomfort. Be ready to work on it
   * Plumbing, electrical etc are all pretty simple if you know how to follow pipes or wires. It's been fun learning how the thing works.
   * If you don't feel like you're handy or willing to be, RV life probably isn't for you. It takes basic troubleshooting and the ability to turn a wrench, but nothing overly complicated
* Size: A lot of people will probably say stuff about storage, personal space etc. We're in a 36' Class A, as a couple and two dogs. It's plenty of space with all the amenities of home. After just a couple weeks of observing, I'm absolutely convinced Class A is the way to go. Easy to drive and it feels like home.",27,0.149626532,0.476452479,9/7/21 10:52

- The red flags keep happening but Ben & Louise ignoring or letting it go just increases the tension
- The whole tyre scene just culminates all the tension. I really thought Ben would die from the fall because Paddy let go of the ladder
- 3rd act is very fun a although logic flies out the window a bit
- Louise actually deals with the situation very well and hurts Paddy and co. the most

Mackenzie Davis gives such a great performance as a parent who has had enough, and I loved how resourceful she was.

Speak No Evil,horror,I despised the Speak no Evil Remake (Spoilers),"The reception of the original Speak No Evil seems to follow a generally accepted thread, that European audiences (especially Scandinavians) implicitly understand the idea of continuing to act against your own interests just to be polite and Americans don't.  American reactions are full of ""it's unbelievable that anyone would allow that to happen to their family"" and ""why don't they fight back"". The remake answers those issues and appeals to those people. Commercial movies offer wish fulfillment to their audience. In real life we know that we're mostly powerless. The film of that poor woman on fire on the NY subway shows no one helping, just people filming. Movies will nearly always show the bully getting his comeuppance, the baddie getting beaten because it makes us feel better.

The four main performers all had their strengths of comedy and iconic scenes. That sex scene was, well, powerful - and it definitely got me feeling a certain way about Stephanie Hsu, who is just hilarious in this.

The best part of this was halfway through the movie, my friend turned to me and said ""Ashley Park is Korean so I bet the twist is that she's actually Korean in the movie"", and well what do ya know! My friend called it.

Deva,bollywood,Deva - Reviews and Discussions,"Movie was pre good actually, not sure how it stays up to the original but does not seem like a dishonest or shoddy attempt. Shahid was a treat to watch tho ngl also BGM was fire. No real major mistakes, just little plot holes and unnecessary scenes",22,-0.047916667,0.621527778,1/31/25 7:13
Deva,bollywood,Deva - Reviews and Discussions,"Deva, directed by Rosshan Andrrews, is a remake of the 2013 Malayalam blockbuster Mumbai Police by the same director. The original writers Bobby and Sanjay are joined by Abbas Dalal, Hussain Dalal, Arshad Syed and Sumit Arora in the writing department. While the movie is well made in its own right, the comparisons with the original are inevitable. Especially for those like me who have watched the original multiple times and also watched the recent Telugu movie called Hunt which is also an official remake of Mumbai Police.

TL;DR: Deva is a well-made thriller that could've benefited from a better screenplay and a bit more finesse in editing. Worth a watch in the theater even if you had watched the original.

Now, the details. Deva stars Shahid Kapoor as Dev Ambre, a hot-headed police office in Mumbai who values his friendships with Rohan, played by Pavail Gulati, and Farhan, played by Parvesh Rana, more than his job as a police officer. He naturally invites a few enemies due to his anger issues and it leads to the death of an important character. Deva investigates the case but meets with an accident and loses his memory. How he nabs the culprit forms the rest of the story.

Shahid Kapoor delivered a good performance as the hot-headed cop. He gets to show his emotions well in scenes involving his close friends. Pavail Gulati and Parvesh Rana offer the necessary support to Shahid Kapoor and the bonding among the three was done well.

The background score by Jakes Bejoy stands out and elevates the movie tremendously. The screenplay is well written in preserving the suspense till the climax and is airtight. However, the movie does feel like a chore to watch at some places and that brings me to its writers and the editor.

The original writers Bobby and Sanjay are joined by four others for this Hindi remake. While the original essence was preserved, the story has been modified with small but significant changes to suit the Bollywood crowd. While this worked for me, the screenplay could've been a bit tight. We feel like we are watching the movie for the second time in the second half due to repetition of a few key scenes. This is where I felt the editing by A. Sreekar Prasad could've been a bit crisper to conceal a few details in the movie to enhance the thrill factor in the climax.

When I first heard about this being a remake of a cult classic from Kerala, I was a bit apprehensive and skeptical knowing the history of botched remakes that Bollywood has been taking up lately. But I will say Deva was done well and did not insult the original. It stands tall in its own right thanks to its actors' performances.

Go watch it in the theater.

So why did a Texas school district ban Judy Blume's book, ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret"" - which is largely about puberty and periods - from elementary schools?","This makes me so angry. I was 11 years old when I got my period. 6th grade. It was traumatizing, but my mom set me up with pads and Tylenol and snacks. She said I could stay home from school, but I said no because I knew people go to work on their periods all the time and I was no little bitch.

I will never fucking forget the PAIN and cramping I experienced after lunch time. Up until then, the pain was annoying but manageable. I went up to my teacher crying, so she set up a little blanket and pillows for me behind her desk where I proceeded to lay on in the fetal position for the next hour and a half while I waited for my mom to come get me. 

It was a free day, maybe we had a class party, something fun was happening. Once kids started noticing I was behind the desk, they got curious. I told one of my friends, she proceeded to tell everyone, ‚Äúshe has her period! Leave her alone!‚Äù This turned into a short discussion where the teacher explained what periods are, why they‚Äôre important, and why sometimes we have to be extra gentle to people on their period because it hurts sometimes. She also kept bringing me snacks l.

The immediate compassion I got from my classmates was insane. My teacher turned it into a teachable moment while also keeping me as comfortable as she could. I learned A LOT about compassion that day too. 

I also remember she was surprised I got my period so young. I can‚Äôt believe kids are getting them even younger, and that‚Äôs the new normal. These people are fuckin covering their eyes and pretending that normal bodily functions don‚Äôt exist?? How irresponsible. And frankly evil. Had my teacher not intervened, I would have thought I was dying. Instead, she set the tone for all of my periods for the rest of my life.

#So true

**BatesNorman** (8): Late stage capitalism has a way of seeping into even the most benevolent and purest aspects of our society in an attempt to crush all forms of human expression under the almighty profit. When I first heard this song, I thought that they were saying ""party rockers in the house tonight.‚Äù I later learned that the lyrics were actually ‚Äúparty rock is in the house tonight.‚Äù I first brushed this off an unimportant but while I was reading volume 3 of Das Kapital it suddenly made sense. Most pop songs commodify the idea of having a good time in an effort to enrich themselves and their label owners. The idea of just having a good time with your friends is thrown away and instead you must worship the brand of the pop star, if you aren‚Äôt drinking the same drinks as them or wearing the same brands as them, how could you possibly be having a good time? But LMFAO throws that all away and democratizes the concept of the party for the proletariat. Party rock is in YOUR house, you don‚Äôt have to go seek it out and buy their products to party rock, you‚Äôre already doing it. Where is party rock right now you may ask? It‚Äôs in the house of the girl reading this.",77,0.19068323,0.488509317,4/4/21 15:34

It‚Äôs also approved by her estate so it‚Äôs unlikely to show the fuckedupness of her family. Houston was a product of r/raisedbynarcissists. The autobiography written by her mother is disturbing. From her own admittance, her ‚Äútraining‚Äù repeatedly brought Houston to tears and made her resent singing all together.  She comes across as mean and condescending even when trying to make herself appear righteous. Her entire account of her child‚Äôs life is incredibly condescending and brutal, reiterating that Houston would not have been anything with our her. In early
career interviews, Houston showed extreme deference to her mother while her mother in turn seems particularly cold before and after Houston‚Äôs death.  Yet she makes the point in her book that she doubts her daughter ever loved her. 

Houston‚Äôs father/manager also stole much of her money throughout her career and even sued her for $100 million on his death bed. 

Her drug addiction began because her older brothers gave her cocaine at 13. Her best friend/ early companion Robyn Crawford claims that while Houston was a teen, her parents allowed her brother‚Äôs to steal the money Houston made from modeling/background singing for drugs. She was also pressured to keep them employed when her record career got off the ground. It‚Äôs likely that they were an ongoing negative influence.

Ted 2,movies,Why did Ted 2 flop?,"I just finished the movie yesterday and here are some reasons I didn't like it.

1. Ted and Lori got divorced off screen. Their relationship was the basis of John's overall character development in Ted 1. The story showed John balancing his relationship with Ted with his relationship with Lori and in the end he manages to find a way to balance the two relationships. Ted was even willing to use his dying words to try and fix John and Lori's relationship. I get that there were real life reasons Lori was written off but it doesn't change the fact that it has undone the development John went through in the first movie. The film should have been made when Mila Kunis was free. They could have made such a great story with Lori being still a character. Imagine this: After becoming jobless after her boss dies of Lou Gehrig's disease, Lori decides to pursue her own career and become a lawyer. While preparing for her bar exam, Ted and John search for lawyers to take Ted's case, but to no avail. Lori then says she passed her bar exam and decides to take Ted's case as her first pro bono case. That would have pushed the film further in the right direction. If not that I read somewhere that the writers considered killing her off. Forgive me for sounding like a psycho but that could have probably made the film more engaging.
2. Actually on second thought that's the only reason I didn't like it. So I guess saying I didn't like it is a step too far.
3. On third thought actually, Ted didn't really need a sequel. The first movie left on quite a good note and didn't really need any follow-up. The movie made its messages clear: Balance your relationships and friendships, don't neglect your girlfriend, the world doesn't make sense anymore and nobody cares.
4. Going back to making the film engaging, the film kinda lacked engagement. Like, take Samantha. She starts off as a good character, she's someone the main characters relate to and she's a love interest for John. But after she fails Ted's case, she goes to New York to get another lawyer for Ted. But that lawyer let's her down. This could have been a good moment for some character development, Samantha learns that she can't trust those she looked up to and has to figure the issue out for herself. She then researches lots and works hard and eventually pulls together a strong case and wins her case. But no, they instead just show the other lawyer have a change of heart and he wins Ted's case for her. That was just bad writing.

So to answer your question, it was a bad movie. People didn't like it. People told their friends they didn't like it. Nobody else bought tickets to watch the movie in cinema. So the movie flopped.",4,0.173167212,0.461686552,11/26/23 12:21

When you want to like something so much you fail to see the imperfections. Season 1 was so good, a lot of people fell in love with the show. Unfortunately second season is not as good.

The number one reason why this show was successful was because it felt genuine. And I think they have compromised on that by leaning deeper into what has been liked. For example, we all loved Ted's quirky southerner comments and sayings. In season 2 Ted literally responds every single thing with an old American saying or a joke. It's fun and enjoyable if you do it every once in a while but the guy stopped responding like a normal person completely.

I agree that it‚Äôs currently cheesy, but that was always the charm of the show. It‚Äôs a cheesy feel-good show on the surface with a lot below the surface. I think Season 1 lets us see below the surface more often than season 2 has so far.

But if people panic and start upgrading 30‚Äì40 days earlier, it could jam up the regular processing and trigger a vicious cycle where everyone feels forced to pay for premium.

Shaft,golf,Educate me: does shafts really matter?,"Yes, they can matter a lot I have 3 stories from my recent past that illustrate how shaft selection has impacted me.  


* Fall of 2022 I won a set of Takomo irons, The KBS Tour shaft in the irons hit the ball a lot higher and with more spin than I was use to coming from DG S300. Playing into any sort of wind I had to flight the ball down or risk the ball ballooning and falling well short of the target. I ended up experimenting with balls like the AVX to counteract the shaft‚Äôs influence in the clubs.
* Spring of 2023 I began building myself a new set of irons, was already in the works when I won the Takomos. I was moving into a 95 gram graphite shaft. I planned the build out as much as I could to ensure that I could match my desired swingweight and thought I put together a pretty good set. But early this year when I went to the range after along break I was hitting the horribly, I put the Takomo‚Äôs  back in the back and instantly starting hitting them better. While the clubs were built to feel and play similarly, the overall weight difference in the shaft was the performance threshold. I needed the extra weight in the club to help with my dispersion and control
* I realized the above when during the same time I made a shaft change in my driver, moving from a 60g to an 85g shaft of similar profiles. With the 60g shaft the club felt loose and hard to control. Moving up to 85g the club felt point and shoot.

For me I learned that I‚Äôm very sensitive to the weight of the shaft, as too light of a weight was hard for me to precisely control.",7,0.053591131,0.400749944,3/20/24 8:50
Shaft,golf,Educate me: does shafts really matter?,"Hand me an iron with any shaft, and I can play it. I've heard very good fitters say that the most important aspect of shaft selection is weight, and feel.

A shaft itself has very little effect on ball flight. Have a robot hit 10 different shafts with an identical swing, and you won't see much difference. But different weight, and different profiles, can change your timing, and effect how you deliver the club to the ball.

&#x200B;

For someone with average or above average swing speed, I don't think flex is as important as people claim it to be. If you can hit a 120g R flex shaft, than you can hit a 120g X flex shaft. You might not like how it feels, but you shouldn't have any problem with hitting the ball. The reason pros play X flex is mainly because they have lower dispersion.

Where flex can be important, is for someone with low swing speed, that has trouble getting the ball in the air. Going to lighter weight, and much softer flex can make a difference.

&#x200B;

I think fitting for high handicappers is very overrated.",3,0.164645833,0.510166667,3/20/24 8:39
Shaft,golf,Educate me: does shafts really matter?,"The shaft absolutely matters and it is very specific to each person because the speed, timing, and tempo of each person‚Äôs swing. 

My example was when i got a driver fitting. I was swinging a stiff driver that was shortened 1‚Äù. My dispersion was every where. I couldn‚Äôt feel where or what the head was doing. I was over powering the shaft based on swing speed  +110 mph. Went to an xstiff and my dispersion tightened up drastically. Tried a few different xstiff shafts, some felt dead in my hand, like swinging a pool cue, but one felt rrrreally good and gave me my best numbers, even at 120mph club head speed it felt good and was stable. Number backed it up, so i bought the shaft and built the club. It‚Äôs a weapon off the tee now.

There are different levels of fittings, and most people just need to try 10 different shafts and go with the one that has the best numbers and best feel. Once you have the best shaft for your swing, you can take that confidence to the course, knowing your club will do what you expect.",3,0.374107143,0.45390625,3/20/24 9:39

-Tracking devices (the iphone watch)

-Infiltrating the secret lair that is booby trapped (the pawn shop)

-Zoom and enhance to find someone's location (the family messing with the Instagram photo)

Thelma,movies,Official Discussion - Thelma [SPOILERS],"This is why I go to the movies. This is hands down my favorite movie of the year so far. Like many have already said it really nailed how to be funny, heartwarming, but a bit sad and introspective at the same time. Which is hard to do! The relationship between Thelma and her grandson Danny is so pure and sweet, it couldve easily veered into ""old people get stuff done, young people are useless"" territory but the movie never framed Danny as some useless lazy youth. Yeah he feels a bit aimless, he's clearly going through some stuff and has really suffocating parents (my one complaint about this movie is that this storyline couldve been explored a bit more), but he's also such a kind and loving dude who worries about his granny and wants to make sure she's safe. Reading that Fred Hechinger ""comes over for dinner [at June's apartment] regularly since the movie wrapped, sometimes unannounced"" warms my heart.

Ben was such a good foil to Thelma's stubborn and reckless character. He also provided a different POV, Thelma fiercely values her independence but Ben accepts that he needs extra help and he is happy with his decision to live in a home. (With all those delicious melons! haha.) Richard's line delivery when he said ""I didn't hear her when she fell"" deserves a best supporting actor nom. It hit hard. Damn I wish Richard was still here to promote the movie and see all the positive reactions :(

I think the movie made great use of the 90 minute runtime and seeing lots of things mentioned earlier in the movie come back later to serve the plot was so satisfying. >!Thelma's temporary amnesia, Ben's retirement home teaching residents how to help each other after falls, Chekhov's Titanium hip. Chekhov's Starey Gary.!< There were more and I want to watch it a second time to catch them all! The climax was more tense than it had any reason to be! This movie is great at magnifying trivial obstacles, like a stair step and a pop up ad. The score helped a lot. Tom Cruise rode a motorcycle off a cliff? Well *Thelma* barrel rolled across a rickety bed!

There's more I want to say but I'm such a clumsy writer. Anyway, this was a personal 10/10 for me. Please watch! And stay for the mid credit scene ‚ù§",181,0.149056607,0.49914061,6/28/24 3:48

It‚Äôs rushed but also for long periods a boring slog. It has terrible pacing and ruined one of the best characters in the franchise with mommy issues

It‚Äôs also a pretty fitting capstone on UC and (pre-Unicorn) made good on fulfilling the ultimate promise of newtypes. 

But I honestly think that without the draw of the returning lead characters, F91 is a better, more enjoyable movie",2,0.188461538,0.669230769,5/13/25 7:24
Counterattack,Gundam,What do people think of Char‚Äôs Counterattack?,"I watched *Char‚Äôs Counterattack* not long right after *ZZ* as well, and while the animation and action are stellar, the pacing makes it feel like we‚Äôre missing key pieces. Char‚Äôs transformation from the conflicted leader in *Zeta* to the bitter, almost fatalistic figure in *CCA* feels abrupt. If *CCA* hadn‚Äôt been greenlit so early, maybe *ZZ* could have bridged the gap more effectively given that Char appears in the first OP.

The line about Lalah being like a mother felt especially strange and out of step with his character, but perhaps this is to show is poor mental state at this point. I preferred how *Beltorchika‚Äôs Children* (the manga) handled that moment ‚Äî the reference to his sister felt more grounded and in character.

The Axis Shock ending didn‚Äôt land for me either. It came off as a straight-up deus ex machina with no real explanation. I‚Äôve always liked the idea of Newtypes as advanced pilots with heightened perception, and not miracle workers who can save the world through sheer will. As for Quess and Hathaway, I know they annoy a lot of people, but I honestly felt pretty indifferent toward them.

In retrospect, *CCA* reminds me of *F91* ‚Äî both are stories that really needed more time to breathe. A short OVA series could‚Äôve done wonders here. There‚Äôs a compelling character arc buried in *CCA*, but we only get fragments of it before everything rushes to the finish line.",4,0.160582011,0.530335097,5/13/25 2:18

MaXXXine,horror,How do people feel about Maxxxine?,"I thought it was awful. I think it failed to deliver on any of its promise. X and Pearl weren‚Äôt anything crazy unique or original, but at least they had something to latch onto, in Maxxxine there‚Äôs just nothing. It‚Äôs just the worst kind of 80‚Äôs pastiche. So many montages that only had the point of saying ‚Äúhey guys! It‚Äôs the 80‚Äôs‚Äù. And the plot was just terrible. The only compelling thing was Maxxxine‚Äôs takeaway from X being that these girls need to save themselves, until she conveniently changes her mind later for seemingly no reason other than the plot needs her to do something. The whodunnit was obvious, her father was an over the top silly campy evil in a way that did not add to the film but actively took away from it. At the end, the film seems to be saying that Maxxxine made some bad moral choice for fame by killing her dad and acted like it was this big decision, but he literally tortured and killed people and would‚Äôve done the same to her? So why is it acting like this moment is her selling her soul for fame? 

As a movie it‚Äôs fine at best, but as something that seemed like it was going to be the thematic culmination of a trilogy, it failed miserably. It doesn‚Äôt build off the previous two movies in a way that‚Äôs even remotely compelling. It‚Äôs just another vehicle for Mia Goth to be crazy and hot.

MaXXXine,horror,How do people feel about Maxxxine?,"Each movie in the trilogy is in a different cinematic style, commensurate with the era it is set in. X is a gritty, old-school slasher in the vein of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, set in the seventies. Pearl is an old-Hollywood studio-era horror film, complete with epic theatricality and Technicolor, set in the early twentieth century (admittedly, the era Pearl is set in and the era of Technicolor are a bit off, but Pearl is meant to be evocative of The Wizard of Oz, which was also set during that era). Maxxxine is an eighties giallo movie, like something Dario Argento would've made. 

Personally, I love each of them in their own way. Arguing which is better seems like missing the point to me. They're each supposed to be distinct from each other, so it's really an apples/oranges/bananas argument. But that's just my take.",205,0.159615385,0.436538462,10/7/24 10:05

2. **X-Men: The Animated Series (1992)** - Had a cameo in an episode in 1995. 

3. **Avengers: United they Stand (1999)** - Was a main character in the first Avengers focused cartoon.

4. **Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2 (2006)** - She was a main character in both these animated movies. This was based on the Ultimate Universe.

5. **The Super Hero Squad Show (2005)** - She appeared in a few episodes.

6. **Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (2010)** - Objectively the best Avengers cartoon featured her heavily and arguably, she was very lovable in it.

7. **Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers (2014)** - The 50+ episodes long anime that never aired in the U.S. despite the dub-work being completed featured her as the only female Avenger in the show. She was a main character in all the episodes.

8. **Marvel's Avengers: Secret Wars (2017)** - Fourth season of Avengers Assemble features Wasp as a main character. However it's Hope van Dyne. Not Janet.

9. **Marvel Future Avengers (2017)** - The newest marvel anime once again features Janet as the only female member of the team. The show is currently airing.

The Bikeriders,TrueFilm,Discussion about ‚Äú The Bikeriders‚Äù,"i agree with this serving as a deconstruction of the bike mythology, also having a title that maybe doesnt sound exciting but describes the group exactly as they are at the most basic level

I was kind of surprised to hear a lot of responses call out ""nothing having happened"" because it served as a hang out movie (jeff nichols' words) and I havent seen other movies of that type get called out as much.  I suppose it could be because of the structure of the movie shifting from the glory days (scenes where it might seem to glorify the experience with the cool needledrops) to where it takes on more of the hooligans/rebels vibes.  I didnt take issue with the pacing and I havent seen anyone call it satirical in any sense.  that scene where johnny watches the Marlon Brando movie is probably one of the most important scenes because it starts the beginning of this family guy pretending to be someone who he really is not (and Benny is just the idealized version of that)

I found Hardy to be great, in a subtle way.  Specifically that nighttime lit scene where hes telling Benny, ""it's you.""    As far as Nichols' filmography goes, it's about on par with Take Shelter for me but I feel Mud is his strongest

this movie just worked for me.  I guess the main three leads are in a somewhat similar space to the tug and war nature of Challengers (very different context though).  In that case I feel Bikeriders was much stronger and I just didnt care for Challengers.  I sort of got this from this letterboxd ""review"" [https://letterboxd.com/hugefilmguy/film/the-bikeriders/](https://letterboxd.com/hugefilmguy/film/the-bikeriders/)",18,0.228968254,0.536349206,10/23/24 16:43

It looked like the other movies from the past couple of years that seemed mediocre at best. I saw this movie on a plane and it started off fairly unoriginal, but I'm rooting for Austin Butler. I like him and felt he wasn't getting the right roles for his acting style.

As the movie went on I felt more and more connected to the characters and by the end I felt the movie fully and deeply. It had somethings that seemed a little goofy like the girl's accent or Tom Hardy's accent or the over abundance of star power that seemed like a little much, but it was good. Everything really comes together as the movie progresses and the times change. It went from a middle of the road gangster movie to a movie about brotherhood. It was compelling and should get more appreciation. Thank you for talking about it. I forgot that it made such an impact on me",7,0.156168831,0.408441558,3/29/25 22:21

The Bikeriders,TrueFilm,The Bikeriders (2023) - It's about a society on its way down,"I also think it was about performative masculinity and the search of meaning in life. At the start of the movie Kathy says ""all they do is drive around"", and that's true, that's all there is to it. All the codes, honour, rules and hierarchy of the group is entirely made up, it does not hold any value outside of itself. They're just a bunch of guys riding motorcycles in their free time after work. They're living an empty life, Austin Butler's character is just a young man lost in life looking for a father figure, and the group gives them meaning, something to hold on to. When you hold on to these markers of hyper masculinity, use them for your (or in this case, the groups) identity, it's easy for them to overwhelm you and take over, and that's what happens. What was an excuse to form a group it suddenly becomes the main drive and you get lost in the rules you yourself have created. Kinda like fight club, in a sense",3,0.13,0.474166667,3/31/25 17:35

The Score,CPTSD,I hate it when people recommend The Body Keeps the Score,"First, I want to say that I'm really sorry that this book was triggering for you, and that it has been a harmful recommendation for you in your own journey. And I want to thank you for sharing how this book negatively impacts you. As a person who *has* recommended this book to several people, I will definitely rethink this, and be more mindful of the ways it could be hurtful and unhelpful. 

I first read this book as a way to help me understand and better support the people in my life who have PTSD, some of whom have PTSD from their military service. I was never able to be finish it completely, because it was too raw for me, and part of the reason was that it is the book that made me realize I *also* have (C)PTSD. 

I skipped around a lot through chapters, and so I started in the middle, reading about EMDR, research into brain difference, Pavlov's accidental discovery about trauma reactions, and the story about the couple who had been through a car accident together. I missed a lot of the content that you mentioned, because once I realized that everything I'd been struggling with was actually a *trauma response* I stopped reading it and reached out for trauma-informed therapy. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the information in this book may have saved my life, but that doesn't mean it's a *good* book. 

Since I couldn't finish it, I passed it to a friend who was struggling with PTSD, and who was not making progress with her therapy. She read it all in a few days, and then passed it on as well. I lost track of who has it now, but I know it helped a number of people better understand their own trauma and healing journey. Because of that, I have recommended it to others who feel stuck in their own trauma recovery, to provide additional tools to understand themselves. But that recommendation always came with a caveat that I hadn't read all of it, and that it was a very heavy read. I see from your comments that it was irresponsible to make this recommendation without having read the entirety, and that it could in some circumstances add additional elements of harm to the healing process.

Given what you have said here, and with the acknowledgement that I clearly missed some elements of this book, I will stop recommending it. I have yet to find another book that was so helpful to my understanding of my *own* PTSD, but I have found several others that have dramatically impacted my *healing* process, and I will center any recommendations on these instead. 

Thank you, again, for sharing your thoughts. I know it can be incredibly vulnerable to call out popular opinion as harmful, and I appreciate you doing the emotional labor to help people understand problematic recommendations.",109,0.108507958,0.493932361,11/8/20 7:30

I remember when my therapist told me that she used to work with sex offenders who were court-appointed to have therapy. I felt so betrayed - how could this person who specialized in trauma and sexual abuse trauma in particular see any humanity in the terrible acts of these perpetrators? I felt that they weren't worthy of care after what they'd done to others - they had sacrificed their humanity to do what they did.

I still feel this way but my therapist posited mental and psychiatric treatment as a human right, and that helped me at least accept it. She stated that no matter how terrible the person, it would be inhumane to leave a prisoner with a broken bone or an untreated physical ailment. She also suggested that treating sex offenders was good for society at large, as they would be eventually released (unfortunately, in most cases) and there should at least be some effort to rehabilitate them. I don't have any personal compassion for rapists, but her explanation at least helped me feel not as betrayed. 

As for the book, I do think it's more directed at other clinicians than for those dealing with PTSD and CPTSD. It did help me to better understand and accept that some of my physical health issues were a result of trauma.",142,-0.001086957,0.517028986,11/8/20 7:01

The Score,CPTSD,Finally reading ‚ÄòThe Body Keeps The Score‚Äô‚Äî I get it now.,"> I am not one broken, defective alien placed in a foreign family on a foreign planet, I am a child who was not seen, heard, or tended to. A child who had learned to cope by blocking everything out and shutting everything down. A child that did all it knew to do to survive.

That's a great summary of what it comes down to. There's nothing wrong with *you*. In fact, you managed to survive a hell-hole, where you were both blamed and told everything was fine around you.

And the stuff you learned to do - that's not faulty cognitions you somehow picked up. Those were your tools for survival, in that environment.

In order to make it through, you had to be on permanent red alert, and your brain and nervous system changed. And because the experiences were overwhelming, your brain and nervous system did not let the full force come crashing down on you, at the time.

I wish Dr. van der Kolk could see this . . . he wrote the book for people just like you.",28,0.015384615,0.458974359,8/4/22 17:17

Pushpa 2: The Rule (Reloaded Version),IndianCinema,Pushpa 2 is not that bad,"When i signed up for the movie (part 1) , I wanted to see him actually rise to the high rank. But I felt like it happened quickly. Never faced any opposition. The heroine sequences in part 1 were abysmal. He asked her to kiss more money but later fought because someone did the same. But the shekhawat actually made me have hopes for part 2. The music was top notch too. 


But part 2 sucked in the majority of the elements. Awkward screenplay. Bad characterization and arcs. The heroine was better here. Being an horny wife is fine lol , that's at least a personality... Part 1 she had no personality. But you can judge by the unnecessary scenes , a couple of them starting from her navel what was the intended purpose of the character. Eye candy. Don't get me started with how shekhawat was buried. Music kinda sucks too. Works for reels but not on an objective level. The oo antava from part 1 had more soul for an item song than any songs in here except the one after the goddess one .

Second one, nobody else is allowed to be as smart nor as strong as him and also he's the perfect family man, protector of women, has his wife dying to fuck him without even trying etc. Even wins over his brother who didn't acknowledge him, literally the only headache he had.

Meet Joe Black,movies,Can we discuss Meet Joe Black,"*Meet Joe Black* is a good movie, but if you don't know what you're in for before you sit down to watch it, you will fucking *hate* it.  The trailers push it as a fish-out-of-water romantic comedy.  Ha-ha, Brad Pitt is Death incarnated in human form, and he's flipping out over peanut butter!  He meets a girl and falls in love!  That's so CRAZY!  But that's not what the film is, and I think it's why critics were so polarized about it.

That's not what it is.  It's a film about lowercase-d *death* and it is quite purposefully slow and deliberate (it's almost three hours long, and not a hell of a lot happens).  The pace is roughly similar to another Pitt film, *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.*  Anthony Hopkins, who fucking crushes his role as Death's guide in the world, remarks at the age of 65 that the years have gone by in a blink, and it's true.  The days are long, as they say, but the years are short, and I think that's why the movie has the pacing that it does.

Pitt and Claire Forlani have almost zero chemistry, and again it's by design.  Pitt is quirky and detached in the role, and expresses emotions as someone who has never had them before.  Pitt is tasked with playing an eternal, supernaturally powerful and wise character who feels emotions for the first time, requiring a mix of confusion and surprise but also composure.  Whether you buy Pitt's performance, I think, will determine whether or not you enjoy the film or laugh at the absurdity of it all.",54,0.035846561,0.547883598,4/11/16 9:55

Just a few examples:

1) Bill is told he'll get to stay alive for as long as death is entertained. Once he gets bored, he will kill him.

So why wouldn't Bill, a supremely wealthy individual treat death to a crazy journey of thrills?

He takes him to board meetings and family dinners.

2) Bill doesn't react like a normal person would when knowing they will die. He doesn't go wild or try to enjoy anything for the last time.

He doesn't give emotional speeches. He doesn't try to beg or bargain with death. ""You love my daughter? Great. Stay here and get married . Let's all live forever.

3) They make out death doesn't even know how to dress or eat. They could have put him in more comedy situations with him not understanding the world.

4) The romance wasn't believable between Pitt and girl . The dialogue wasn't strong enough.

5) Bill didn't have any great revelations in the end except ""oh. My ugly , worthless daughter isn't so bad.

The only revelations death had was that he liked peanut butter and getting his dick wet.

Meet Joe Black,movies,Meet Joe Black ending is problematic.,"Here's a hot take on the ending for all of you to consider: the moment that Joe and Bill cross that bridge, Death  changes the entire timeline of events preceeding, basically ""resets"" everything. When coffee shop guy walks back over the bridge, it's no longer to a birthday party, it's to a remembrance of life celebration. There's not a dead body laying at the end of the bridge, Bill died the day he had the heart attack. The car accident never happened - the just walked away from each other. Susan knows her father is dead, that's why she says ""I wish you could have known my father."" 

Basically, Death simply converts everything instantaneously to a more natural timeline, complete with all the characters being where they ""should"" be - physically and emotionally. He just puts coffee shop guy there with a fuzzy kind of half memory of ""time that has elapsed"", which he immediately gets over because he and Susan know they will ""figure it out.""

No need to worry about what ifs, legal documents etc. And all the business with Drew doesn't matter because at the time of his death, none of the merger mess had happened. Sure, business BS might be happening in the ""corrected"" timeline, but it has no relevance to the point, which is basically fate, certainty of death, and loving life fully. Just my take.",15,0.120175439,0.441081871,9/22/24 22:03

Grey Lady,ArtHistory,The Execution of Lady Jane grey by Paul Delaroche. She died so young...,"It's interesting to note all the ways the 19th century painter got 16th century clothing styles right and wrong. For example, the lacing on Jane's corset is nicely done. It shows the proper front lacing corset with a spiral pattern used in the 1500s, instead of the back laced x pattern common in later times. However, Jane and both of her ladies are wearing a corset shape more common in the 1800s. Tudor corsets tended to create a rigid, cylindrical/cone shape throughout the torso instead of creating a small waist that curved out into a round bosom.

Delaroche clearly did a lot of research, and he got so many tiny details, like the Tudor blackwork embroidery on the lady to the left, correct. However, he seems to have altered overall silhouettes and clothing shapes to appeal to a 19th century audience. ",15,0.055042017,0.395238095,7/5/18 11:19

Grey Lady,AskHistorians,Why is Lady Jane Grey considered such a tricky historical subject?,"I love that documentary and Helen Castor's work. In my classes on Tudor history we touched on Jane Grey briefly. For the most part, Lady Jane is tricky because it's difficult to confidently place her in the timeline of the British Monarchy because of the circumstances of her short rule. She was named the heir by Edward over his two sisters and on his death was the first proclaimed female monarch but she was never coronated and so was never officially Queen because Mary was able to claim the throne after 9 days. It's kind of how Charles is now, he's effectively king but he's not officially king until he's coronated. 
No one who already had power wanted Mary, who was Catholic, or Elizabeth, who was considered illegitimate since Anne Boleyn was accused of infidelity to sit on the throne. It's also difficult to know how much agency Jane had in the decision especially since she was still a teenager. She was married to the son of Northumberland who was acting as a sort of regent while the young king was ill. Putting Jane on the throne would ensure he kept his power and that his own son became king as well. (This isn't to say Jane was weak, as a Tudor, she was very well educated and wasn't afraid to express her own opinions) 
The document that named her heir also only named the males born to Jane's mother Francis and then Jane and then her sister Margaret so the women were really only placeholders until a boy was born. This was true until Edward changed it at the last minute to also include Jane herself when it became clear that there would be no male heirs before succession had to be solidified. The succession was never publicly announced and Jane was never even informed that she was made the heir. This surprise made the public sceptical of Jane as a Queen as Henry VII named Mary and Elizabeth as his heirs so naturally Mary should be the Queen. The documentary mentions a couple of times how going against the natural order of successon would be seen as too chaotic and nit reflect well on Jane.
Jane is a tricky subject because she was only technically an heir and not publicly named, didn't have the best claim to the throne both through parentage and the fact that when she was named queen her mother was still alive (who should have been named as the one higher in the line but wasn't made heir in that document), and was probably forced into the role by people who wanted to control the throne through her. You can pick a stance on whether or not she should be considered a true queen and you could argue your stance with the evidence we have but there's just as much evidence the other way as well.

ETA: all of this information is in the documentary so I know none of this is new to you. The answer to your question comes down to how much strife surrounded Jane and her time as queen and how that makes it difficult to tell her story. You can even see it in the interviews they do where some people believe she was just a pawn of Northumberland and some believe she was in control of what was happening.",41,0.083595211,0.453119155,11/28/22 13:39

Memoirs of a Geisha,iwatchedanoldmovie,I watched Memoirs of a Geisha (2005),"It's an amazing movie and book. I saw it back when it first came out and read the book, I was obsessed. It's like a twist on a Cinderella story, and I think that's where the major appeal comes for me. Seeing Chiyo's transformation into a geisha is like watching two different people, but she becomes everything she ever wants before the war happens. I love how it feels dramatic in the movie. You want her to succeed. You worry for her when things go bad. 

I especially loved the costumes. Seeing how many layers it took for her to put on her kimono and how pretty the fabrics were. 

I know the movie can be flawed, but it shows the relationship of the characters so well. I especially give credit to Gong Li, who really did an excellent job making Hatsumomo so vicious.  Also Zhang Ziyi did an excellent job as Sayuri. I thought the scene with the dance was my favorite as a kid. 

I liked the book ending a bit better, because she ends with explaining her life after the ending scene of the movie. You get to know what happened with the Chairman. The movie just shows a happy ending to a fairy tale which I loved at the time it was released, but now I realize the book did explain a lot better. 

I had read the book before I saw the movie, so I was pretty aware of what each thing was. Now watching the movie as an adult (I was 15) when I saw it, some things stand out more to me. I never understood the cakes they gave to their potential mizuage choices. Well, now I totally do and I think to myself how awkward woulrnit be to be caught giving someone one. I totally understood the meaning behind it as I got older. Slipped my brain as a teen.

Also the rivalry between Pumpkin and Sayuri upset me more as a teen. I think also I feel sorry for Nobu because he got the short end of the stick. Sayuri never really gave him a chance, I feel. Sometimes her conversations feel forced with him. What saddens me is, he opened himself up to liking geisha and she pretty much shows him a reason why he shouldn't like them. Sometimes I wish she had picked Nobu instead of the Chairman, because whose to say that the Chairman would reciprocate Sayuri? I sometimes wish he had rejected her just to show realistic actions. Of course have him be her friend, but never her Danna. 

Growing up made me think more reasonably about the plot. But I still agree the movie is amazing and the book paints a great picture. 

Also another thing is, Arthur Golden faced a lawsuit because he revealed the name of the geisha when he was sworn to secrecy. So it makes me think differently about the story and his intentions as a writer. ",1,0.174754902,0.613071895,5/18/18 9:48

Retro,kollywood,"Retro Review - Retro is a brilliantly written, wonderfully crafted, and technically strong movie.","Ok I respect ur decision bro but hard disagree on 1st positive thing. While watching that climax not even once in my thoughts of randomness, I felt like KaSu respected my time. Now before anyone judges me. I liked it. I liked the proceedings of first half. I liked the interval block (reminded me of Leo but still I liked) I liked the cult back drop and what he stands for. That anarchism ideologies all are good I did liked it. The place where all started to go south was when he wanted to pull that Bahubali moment at the beach fight. Seriously I was so invested in the entirety of the film and then he goes to one which felt so rushed. Until that moment it‚Äôs about the power war between these 3 guys. Now it becomes the saviour and messiah thing. I know that songs already gives that hint but stuffing that at the last 40 mins doesn‚Äôt do any good to the movie. If that‚Äôs what u really wanted to do. Why not do it from the first. Also he just returns to his family. And seriously man even if he helped them because Rukmani wants it would be more good as she is the sole reason why he was there. Bringing this point completely sidelines the Rukminis charecter weight and relevance to the story. She should have been the soul of the film or either the focus should be on the one narrative. Now both just destroys each other and doesn‚Äôt give depth to either of the narratives. And for the love of God what the heck is that climax. I just didn‚Äôt get it. Can anyone please explain me what is the significance of the climax and what KaSu is aiming to tell through that climax. Cause I seriously didn‚Äôt get it. And I‚Äôm not meaning it in sarcastic way.

HIT: The First Case,politics,"Trump Sent Nearly 17.8 Tons of Medical Supplies to China After First Coronavirus Case in the U.S. When Shortages Hit, He Blamed Obama","(Copying from a friend's post...numbers are a few days oldnow)

So I thought I would throw up a little history lesson for everyone on both sides of the political divide.  I think it‚Äôs important that we understand the truth, especially come November when it‚Äôs time to vote.  Forgive the length. But, hey we all have time on our hands to read, right?

In December 2013, an 18-month-old boy in Guinea was bitten by a bat. Then there were five more fatal cases.  When Ebola spread out of the Guinea borders into neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone in July 2014, President Obama activated the Emergency Operations Center at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The CDC immediately deployed CDC personnel to West Africa to coordinate a response that included vector tracing, testing, education, logistics and communication. 

Altogether, the CDC, under President Obama, trained 24,655 medical workers in West Africa, educating them on how to prevent and control the disease before a single case left Africa or reached the U.S.

Working with the U.N. and the World Health Organization President Obama ordered the re-routing of travelers heading to the U.S. through certain specific airports equipped to handle mass testing.

Back home in America, more than 6,500 people were trained through mock outbreaks and practice scenarios. That was done before a single case hit America.

Three months after President Obama activated this unprecedented response, on September 30, 2014, we got our first case in the U.S..  That man had traveled from West Africa to Dallas, Texas and had somehow slipped through the testing protocol. He was immediately detected and isolated.  He died a week later. Two nurses who tended to him contracted Ebola and later recovered. All the protocols had worked.  It was contained.  

The Ebola epidemic could have easily become a pandemic. But thanks to the actions of our government under Obama, it never did.  Those three cases were the ONLY cases of ebola in our country because Obama did what needed to be done three months before the first case. 

Ebola is not even as contagious than Covid-19. If he Obama not done these things, millions of Americans would have died awful painful deaths like something out of a horror movie (if you‚Äôve ever seen how Ebola kills, it‚Äôs horrific).  
It‚Äôs ironic that BECAUSE President Obama did these things - we forget that he did them, because the disease never reached our shores.  

Now the story of Covid 19 and Trump‚Äôs response that we know about so far: 

Before anyone even knew about the disease (even in China) Trump disbanded the pandemic response team that Obama had put in place. He cut funding to the CDC. And he cut our contribution to the World Health Organization (WHO).   

Trump fired Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer, the person on the National Security Council in charge of stopping the spread of infectious diseases before they reach our country - a position created by the Obama administration.  

When the Outbreak started in China, Trump assumed it was China‚Äôs problem and sent no research, supplies or help of any kind.  We were in a trade war, why should he help them?

In January he received a briefing from our intelligence organizations that the outbreak was much worse than China was admitting and that it would definitely hit our country if something wasn‚Äôt done to prevent it.  He ignored the report, not trusting our own intelligence.  

When the disease spread to Europe, the World Health Organization offered a boatload of tests to the United States.  Trump turned them down, saying private companies here would make the tests ‚Äúbetter‚Äù if we needed them.  But he never ordered U.S. companies to make tests and they had no profit motive to do so on their own.

According to scientists at Yale and several public university medical schools, when they asked for permission to start working on our own testing protocol and potential treatments or vaccines, they were denied by Trump‚Äôs FDA.  

When Trump knew about the first case in the United States he did nothing.  It was just one case and the patient was isolated.  When doctors and scientists started screaming in the media that this was a mistake, Trump claimed it was a ‚Äúliberal hoax‚Äù conjured up to try to make him ‚Äúlook bad after impeachment failed.‚Äù

The next time Trump spoke of Covid-19, we had 64 confirmed cases but Trump went before microphones and told the America public that we only had 15 cases ‚Äúand pretty soon that number will be close to zero.‚Äù  All while the disease was spreading.  He took no action to get more tests.

What Trump did do is stop flights from China from coming here.  This was too late and accomplished nothing according to scientists and doctors.  By then the disease was worldwide and was already spreading exponentially in the U.S. by Americans, not Chinese people as Trump would like you to believe.  

As of the moment I‚Äôm posting this, the morning of March 22, 2020, we have 15,220 CONFIRMED CASES in the U.S. The actual number is undoubtedly much higher.  But we don‚Äôt know because we don‚Äôt have enough tests.  Why don‚Äôt we have enough tests?  Remember back when Trump turned down the tests from the W.H.O. and prevented our own universities from developing them?  Remember back when Trump had cut the funding to the CDC?  

Every time Mr. Trump goes on camera and blames the previous administration for the mess we are now in, I scream at the reporters from FOX, CNN and MSNBC - ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you reporting the actual historical facts?!‚Äù  How dare Trump try to blame Covid-19 on Obama.  He has no one to blame but himself.  

I hear Republican pundits try to put the blame on China.  And they are correct - after all, the disease started there.  And the Chinese government handled it poorly and dishonestly.  So it‚Äôs fair to blame the government of China for the EXISTENCE of the Covid-19 virus.  BUT THAT MISSES THE POINT.  Obama didn‚Äôt blame Ebola on Guinea.  He helped them stop it.  Trump let the disease invade the U.S.  

And he is still not doing all he could to save lives.  He keeps talking about invoking The Defense Production Act, but hasn‚Äôt actually done so.  He‚Äôs making the same mistake twice - waiting until it‚Äôs too late to take action.  

Invoking that act would require factories with the right equipment and know-how to start producing life saving ventilators for our hospitals, protective masks and other gear for our front line health workers.  And the plus is it would actually employ people to do so.  UPDATE: he just invoked it, FINALLY, way late.

Them‚Äôs the facts.  Take them as you will.  I‚Äôll go back to trying to find toilet paper on-line.",487,0.044848529,0.445417151,3/30/20 16:38
HIT: The First Case,politics,"Trump Sent Nearly 17.8 Tons of Medical Supplies to China After First Coronavirus Case in the U.S. When Shortages Hit, He Blamed Obama","It was criminal negligence. Fox the GOP and the President are all responsible for each of these deaths and the corresponding economic slowdown. QAnon and tons of his other idiot followers all posted that it was a hoax and videos of licking toilets..  

In a sane world the pandemic response team would have identified the new threat, closed off travel and identified everyone exposed quarantining them. Labs would start breaking it down and identifying existing RNA blockers etc to find quick remedies while developing a long term vaccination strategy. Once the vaccine made it to the public risk levels could be reevaluated. Very few deaths and we don't need to loan the rich $$$. Nature is what we make it we aren't oranges we can think our way through problems.

Do you trust the Chinese government? - NO! So to blame China you have to agree that Trump trusted China.. Or he didn't and decided it was a hoax as told to him by QAnon conspiracy theorists. Or worse yet he knew and was delaying to make a profit.",148,-0.069723906,0.384340067,3/30/20 16:16

I thought he'd be stereotypical big boss not letting his underling grow for whatever reasons. Usually in these stories the underling has to work his way out and prove his boss wrong. I love the small twist they take on this trope.

 Sai kumar explaining his take of what a lawyer should do and giving a new perspective to Priyadarshi was amazing. This also changes what we thought of Sai kumar's role, instead of a heartless cold-blooded lawyer arguing against the victim, he's actually a very moral lawyer thinking about the bigger picture.

I don't think Sivaji's character is as nuanced and I don't think he needs to be. He represents the guys already living in our society with that thinking. Slowly the movie shows that even though he says he's doing it for family, he throws them under the bus when it comes to his paruvu (instead of abandoning the case he choses to show the footage on court || also lies that there is no court on that particular day).

The blood and gore in the battles are so extra that it often looks like a Holi celebration with swords.

 Lead hero, who was carrying the entire movie, himself didn't bother to learn Marathi. Nor did the supporting actors like Divya dutta, Ashutosh Rana, and others. These were more pivotal to the story.

The marco polo scene was probably the best scare/tension building moment that was already somewhat revealed in the teasers for the film. I also felt like the lead actor was not a likeable character throughout (we get it, you played baseball), and the ending attempted an unearned emotional moment which completely sunk the film for me.

Mad Square,gifs,"A major intersection in Ethiopia, Meskel Square, that has no traffic signals. Madness.","I lived in Addis for 18 months (2013-2014) and worked in one of the buildings you can see in that GIF. I usually walked to work via another road to avoid Meskel, but there's actually a way to get across that terrifying road. It involves:

* Eye contact with oncoming drivers
* Waiting for 3-4 other people to arrive at the same section of road (the center dividers are your friend)
* Sticking your foot out as if you're about to cross
* Pulling back so some other pedestrian is actually in front of you
* Hurrying behind him/her/them so that you're in the mob and not leading it
* Being not-black helps because people are more afraid to hit foreigner

Vehicles are surprisingly responsive in general, because the legal penalty for striking and hurting a pedestrian is automatic jail time (trials aren't really very complicated in Ethiopia); I knew a foreign tourist who motorbiked into a pedestrian who surprise-jaywalked across the street and was thrown in jail for a week. He had to pay the injured pedestrian's hospital fees (broken leg) as well as a handsome private settlement so that she would not press charges. If she had, I believe he might have served 5-10 years.

Oh, and vehicular manslaughter? I was told that that charge, if found guilty, is just treated as plain-old murder. They take their laws very seriously. (I can't tell, but the GIF may predate these laws.)",53,-0.094551282,0.441987179,1/8/15 2:18

The movie, at least from the trailer,  does inaccurately portray women officers, and people who aren't aware of this might assume that IAF discriminates between its officers.

I agree with their objection, young women wanting to join might think they would be discriminated, or have these stereotypes in mind, and with media hype most people of this country might have same stereotypes...",218,-0.066666667,0.415972222,8/12/20 6:11

Dragon,movies,Official Discussion - How to Train Your Dragon,"Ive already typed some thoughts on this in an earlier comment but I just had some more thoughts:

\- The big addition I noticed was the town hall meeting where they argue the reasons on going on their first dragon attack. It was curious to see this get fleshed out and see how the make up of the clan is made up by a lot of other vikings from around the world? Seems like a good way to be more inclusive and show Stoick at his most stubborn. The theme of generational war is very current.

\- Peter Serafinowicz made me laugh everytime he blanked his son.

\-  I had trouble with Ruffnut & Tuffnut, took me a long time to accept the actors in their roles but Nico Parker was really solid and Ricky Baker is getting paid. Its hard to translate those relationships in the animated film to live action, chemistry is bloody hard to capture.

\- I hope Gerald Butler drank a lot of honey and ginger tea, his voice must be shot after each scene, still he was the MVP in this, he broke me when he started the emotional 'son' scenes and that line saying hes proud that he's his son....I had tears in my eyes. Im sure its harder than it looks from just doing the voice to actually bringing Stoic to life in live action, his wardrobe looked heavy, haha.

\- The Hiccup scene at the end and seeing his 'foot' for the first time hits differently in live action, I was not prepared for that.

\- John Powell's score is still godamman good. Test Drive, Forbidden Friendship elevates those scenes so much.

\- Be curious to see if no.2 (and 3?) will have more substantial changes than this adaption.

\- Cate Blanchett is a must!!!!",259,0.136786988,0.45246732,6/13/25 14:57

It's the same movie, but now in live action, and weaker. And on top of that, it uses so much CGI that it completely ruins the point of it being in live action. The only ""live action"" things in most frames is just the actors. I've seen so many clips from the movie that's been shared over the past couple of weeks, all scenes that are just shot-for-shot remakes. They lack the heart and character of the original. 

I don't get it. I mean, I do, it's money and this thing will print it, but it's frustrating.

TEST,IVF,To test or not to test? ,"Trigger warning: positive test 

I couldn‚Äôt wait and tested early at 4DP5DT. It looked negative, I took a photo of it, and wasn‚Äôt worried because I knew it was early anyway to test positive. Tested the next day and it was definitely positive. When I look back at the photo of the first test I took I swear I see a teeeeeeny tiny shadow of a line. 

Not sure if this makes sense, but I felt like if my tests were negative, I would feel the first day or two that maybe it really is negative OR that it‚Äôs just too early. Then if I kept getting negatives, with each passing day I‚Äôd start to accept that it probably didn‚Äôt work. By the time I had my beta then I‚Äôd already know that it most likely is negative. This way, I‚Äôd sort of ease into the negative if that makes sense rather than having the news hit me like a ton of bricks when getting the results of the beta back. 

I think most people who do test before beta start around 5DP5DT, and if there‚Äôs no line by 8DP5DT, it *likely* didn‚Äôt work but nothings for certain until beta comes back!",3,0.039420996,0.423472823,1/4/25 20:26

Perusu - 7/10. I never thought I would see the day where there would be an adult comedy in tamil cinema like this. The fact they made a tamil movie like this is actually risk taking in my opinion. The whole plot revolves around the patriarch of a family passing away. But, the person dies with a ‚Äúhard‚Äù situation. Thrown into a ‚Äústiff‚Äù situation, the immediate family must do whatever it takes to hide this hilariously weird situation. ‚ÄúPerusu‚Äù has a ‚Äúbig‚Äù idea that will possibly ‚Äústick‚Äù for future adult comedies in tamil cinema to be more creative with the mature humour. The double entendres are creative here, showing that the ‚Äúpen is mightier than the sword‚Äù in terms of effectively being a ‚Äúhammer‚Äù for a plot point. This is definitely a story you would see in an english film, so seeing it in a tamil format is a ‚Äúhumongous‚Äù surprise. In terms of the movie‚Äôs quality, it sort of wanes in terms of effective quality at points, sometimes searching for the next ‚Äúpole‚Äù point in terms of hilarity utilizing this situation. What the movie should‚Äôve done more was focus on how this weird situation was bringing out family secrets and quirks. But either way, I give it a positive review for simply staying true to its conviction to the ‚Äúmassively‚Äù absurd plot device. A comedy that is definitely not a family film!",6,0.084122976,0.504417188,4/13/25 20:34

VidaaMuyarchi,kollywood,Vidaamuyarchi | Review Megathread,"First half just finished. Really slick movie. Production quality is insane. Dialogues are crisp and really builds the story and suspense. No unwanted elevation scenes and cringe screenplay. 4/5 so far

Second half: Methodical script, establishes the motives and has some fantastic action scenes. My favourite was the overhead shot in the Hummer. Climax suddenly rushes through a bit, but sticks the landing.

Overall I‚Äôll give it a 8/10. Really haven‚Äôt seen a Tamil movie quite like this. A sophisticated and grounded action thriller with incredible production value. Handles mature subtones well. Quite a few parallels with Aandavars VV. Much better than the recent lot we‚Äôve had. Best Ajith movie since YA.

Top performance by Ajith. Solid acting, entertaining stunts throughout the film. 

The thing I loved about this film is that there are characters in this film and their writing is very solid even if their actual role is not meaty.

Cinematography was very good, BGM is literally rescored versions of Pathikichu but enough to elevate scenes and entertain the audience.

Magizh did the best thing of trying to get an enjoyment for Thala fans in the first 20 minutes and immediately pulls everybody into the story and the stories of the characters on screen. 

Beware this film is violent but blurred at times. Proper action film from Ajith after god knows how long.",164,0.206875,0.383958333,2/5/25 22:04

Thandel,tollywood,My take on Thandel. What do you all think?,"As a woman, I see it a whit differently. This is such a stereotypical (and bloody convenient) take on men vs women in love. A man in love is seen as a simp & pegged to be ‚Äúunmanly‚Äù. Uxorious and a laughing stock. Because how dare he choose his woman over his duties? Petty. It‚Äôs perfectly okay for him to smoke, drink, & prioritise his friends & career/ responsibilities over his woman, because.. ‚Äúhe is a man‚Äù and that‚Äôs what makes him ‚Äúheroic‚Äù. 

Whereas a woman is supposed to be eternally waiting on her man with her ikigai in life being to please him. She exists to ‚Äúlove him with all her heart‚Äù. To ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù and respect his choices even if he prioritises a million other propositions before her. A woman picking her duties over her man would always be termed a solipsist with folks vilifying her character & calling her names. Heck even a woman choosing her own parents over her boyfriend would be s!ut shamed to oblivion. But a man doing the same would be tagged a virtuous & scrupulous son.

NC did better than what o thought he is capable of but there is still room for improvement. Sai Pallavi did good too. The fiance character is casted well as well. Dubbing was a let down and Pakistan jail element is superficial and a bit logicless. Apparently CHANDOO himself wrote all the details in Pakistan jail hence the lackluster/boring second half.

Thandel,tollywood,Thandel (2025) - Review/Discussion Thread. SPOILERS MUST BE TAGGED,"Have a show that starts in 2 hours. Will update.


Just finished watching first half. It is above average so far. 

The first 15 min or so starts on a bit of a superficial level and the romance feels surface level. As the movie progresses the leads chemistry pulls it off and we connect with their plight.  The railway station sequence and the interval sequence were quite well made. The surprise is surely Nag Chay as he not only acts alright but also does the accent quite convincingly (unlike what we initially fearer). Dude seems to have worked his butt off. 

Will update after the second half.

Second half also is mostly average with great pre climax sequence. Some parts of the movie doesn't land at all. Again, Chay did quite well, especially in the climax portions.

Nadaaniyan,bollywood,Nadaaniyan - Reviews and Discussions,"Watched this, for my sins. My takeaways -

Khushi doesn't have a face made for cinema. Even in the best costuming and hair, her facial proportions look off and her face doesn't move. In a more equitable universe she would be playing the FL's best friend, if that.



Ibrahim similarly doesn't have main lead energy. He's best in the lighter moments, where he doesn't have to 'act'. He's badly equipped to play any deeper emotions. His dad took 10 years to really step into his romcom era.  Wonder what will happen to him.


The story is Never Have I Ever meets kdrama meets SOTY.  I have no idea why Dharma isn't hiring better writers. Even Ananya's character in SOTY2 had a dash of conviction to it. These are paper thin characters. 


The director forgot about some of her own characters. There's no arc for the secondary cast. What happened to Khushi's friends, specially the one who was unhealthily obsessed with her bf? 


Nobody thinks Orry is cool, except Dharma. 


This film would be so much better if they would focus on the parents, I would love to see a love story between Jugal Hansraj and Diya Mirza in particular. They look cute together as a mature couple.",67,0.2745671,0.50021645,3/7/25 11:31
Nadaaniyan,bollywood,Nadaaniyan - Reviews and Discussions,"Got done with the movie.

It is honestly unbelievably bad. No, I am not hating just for the sake of it. It would have been fun to see a harmless, fun rom-com but this is just stupid and juvenile- aided by some terrible acting.

Khushi Kapoor (surprisingly) shows a little bit of improvement, although the bar is set in hell. Ibrahim on the other hand - unbelievably out of place and bad. Not what was expected whatsoever. Moreover, it feels like someone else dubbed for him. Felt very very artificial.

The veterans Dia Mirza, Suneil Shetty and Jugal Hansraj are adequate and honestly, wasted in bland roles.

From a screenplay perspective, there is nothing particularly wrong although there is nothing good to talk about either.

Music is definitely good. But that‚Äôs literally the only saving grace.

Dhoom Dhaam,bollywood,Dhoom Dhaam - Reviews and Discussions,"Absolute fun movie. Movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that probably works for it best. It might appear to be a thriller in parts but it is definitely a comedy at heart and the film tries to stay true to that with the action sequences too being raw and do not feel like carefully choreographed action shots, with perhaps the car sequence being the only real 'action' scene in that.

There is nothing novel about the premise or even the script writing but that is not to say it disappoints. This movie was supposed to be held and kept afloat by yami and pratik and this is exactly what they've done. 

While Pratik is by no means a lightweight, to anyone watching this movie, one thing is clear, it is Yami who is the highlight. Some of the expressions and her acting in some scenes just feel so authentic, you really stop to think, how is she not considered an A-list actress? She's absolutely phenomenal in this. If you're not watching it for the overall package, you can easily just watch this movie for Yami and leave satisfied.

The situational comedy is on point and the movie is by no means close to even being a masterpiece but if you ask me if this is the best movie to have been released by bollywood in the last couple of years, I will probably say yes, considering the stale and over the top badly packaged content we keep being served.

A crisp movie length prevents the movie from feeling stretched and is just the right duration. And even though, some may complain of virtue signalling perhaps, there's nothing beyond the palatable amount and one particular monologue definitely leaves an impact.

I'd give it a square 4/5 (0.5 just for how much better it has been than other movies lately.)",18,0.137405881,0.437192206,2/15/25 4:37

The thing is, at least in the clip i saw she didn't say anything more vulgar than what Samay or Ranveer or anyone else was saying. I've no idea how vulgar or funny she is outside of that but it doesn't matter.

One of the responses she got for her comment is someone 'joking' about how she would enjoy being sexually assaulted by a group of people.

* Hope to see the young front rowers step up, especially AOF. 
* Willis to kick on and put a strong claim for the 8 shirt moving forward. 
* IFW lucky to still be in if he's banned for 2 weeks?

It just touched all the topics on a very surface level 

Even ended with the protagonist liking the kid although, he doesn't want to have kids ( I would still say not revealing that it's his own kid was s good move) many people praised the movie saying it doesn't judge people but in the end it still advocates for a close to conservative family system",99,0.5,0.6,2/17/25 13:30

Nithya is a single parent, who's shown to be way too careless about her kid or her profession. She didnt even explain to the kid about his parentage, that he has to make up stories and try to run away from home in search of his dad, not once but twice...! She's so competitive in trying to get that contract, but at the same time leaves important financial info open for anyone (esp her main competitor) to just walk in and see. 

even detailing in the movie is so bad. the kid is supposed to be real madrid fan, hence jayam ravi gets him a real madrid branded football, but in a later scene the kid is shown wearing a barcelona jersey in multiple scenes.",206,-0.066411565,0.417091837,2/17/25 13:12

And 'Dna' didn't mention her name even in the poster. But after winning the Filmfare for Best Actor (Critics), he wrote a huge paragraph appreciating Nithya for making his performance better. Then why not give equal importance to her character in the film poster? Well, at least mention her name.

All those Instagram posts without backing them up in promotion doesn't make his post about Nithya look genuine.

It's either that, or even Dhanush can't look past the systematic gender bias. I hope it's the latter, but his kindness should be limited to Instagram posts; he should back it up in every aspect. He can't even give any excuse, because he is co-producing and directing it.

Kadhalikka Neramillai,kollywood,"Pongal Releases Megathread - Kadhalikka Neramillai , MadrasKaaran , Nesipaaya, Tharunam","Kadhalikka Neramillai is pretty refreshing. Even though it handled complex relationships, it was handled in a lighthearted manner. Some might want it to be a little bit more dramatic, but this is the meter Kiruthiga set and she is pretty successful in it.
The movie takes many cinematic liberties, still ending up being good. 

Ravi is good in his relatable character. And Nithya was as usual amazing. That kid was also good.
The scenes between those 3 characters were organic. Nithya's single parenting and Ravi coming in between were portrayed well.

There was a pretty predictable scene in the first half, the scene which led to Nithya getting pissed off at her boyfriend. But her intensity in her eyes was outstanding. She simply can elevate such scene. Wish she did a full-fledged intense role.

Also, I thought it would be revealed that >!Ravi was the biological father, but the movie ends in an open-ended manner!<, which I like.

Nithya and Ravi shared really good chemistry as well.",43,0.243887363,0.61717033,1/14/25 6:41

I have a question: if your fianc√©e doesn't show up at your engagement citing a difference, and the same ex-fianc√©e shows up after 8 years out of nowhere at your doorstep, what would your reaction be? Here, the protagonist goes, ""It's a pleasant surprise,"" really?!. Apart from Nithya's character, there is no full-fledged development of any other characters, including Ravi's. Nithya is the only one who has a clear idea of what she wants, whereas Ravi's character just exists to complement hers. For instance, Ravi doesn't want a child, which is why his fianc√©e doesn‚Äôt show up at the engagement, but when it comes to Nithya, he accepts everything she brings.

The Exorcist: Believer,TheExorcist,What is everyone's issue with the exorcist believer?,"It had no soul.  

It was so uneven on a character level that I stopped caring about what happened to any of them. 

Katherine's whole side of the story was criminally underwritten and or edited out.  She was there solely to be ""the other possessed girl "". 

The movie's biggest fault/setback/etc was it's pacing and overall structure. It was every adjective of the word bad. 

""Oooh our daughters are back!""

2 scenes later: 
""They're possessed cuz Jesus was gone 3 days too!""

4 minutes later:
Chris gets stabbed in the eyes. 

There was absolutely no rhyme to any of it as it was all over the place. 

So did the Haitian voodoo priestess help when all that glowing smoke came out from the girls and went into the fireplace? It kind of seemed that way but in the next scene there's absolutely no consequences for any of it. 

They brought Ellen Burstyn back to cheaply use her for nostalgia and bullshit cheap shock value plain and simple.  Not to mention they made her look like such a fool. I didn't appreciate the patriarchy comment either because it made her look ungrateful AF. There was no reason for her to be used this way. None.

Compared to the original this was so PG13 as the girls did nothing shocking whatsoever.  What was with the body and the blood scene? It was stupid and boring. Screaming that in a cheesy demonic voice isn't scary.  

The exorcism scenes were a mess, what exactly is going on again here? I'll tell you what just make sure every culture gets a jab üôÑ.

You can see that David Gordon Green was lost trying to show the audience his ""message"" in these scenes especially.

It all boils down to this in regards to what was wrong with the movie and that was David Gordon Green plain and simple.

Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3,LGBTindia,Thoughts on Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3?,"Very much of the cis gaze.

The first time the camera captures Debu, it is a vouyer (as are Manjulika and Anjulika) in the act of her putting on shringar. This follows a general tendency of representation on film of trans women, as explicated by Julia Serano, of showing her in the act of ""putting on"" feminine garb, giving the audience the impression of the transness of the trans woman as a costume or mask. The trans women cannot be, but must become.

Consider the twist itself: what was the point? Debu's ghost, forced to exist in a locked room, is reconciled with her sisters, gets her old unburned face back, and... disappears? The soul achieves moksha perhaps, but does the body not get to experience 21st century trans technologies? HRT? FFS? SRS? These don't matter to the soul, but they do to the body. Unlike Manjulika and Anjulika, cis women who get reborn as cis women with unburnt faces (remember that Manjulika was also burned at the stake), Debu doesn't get to have the bodily satisfaction of having her body and face aligned with her intrinsic gender.

However, the specific moment of reconciliation is cathartic as wish fulfilment to people who have lost friends and family to queerness. However, this reconciliation should last more than two minutes at the tail end of a two and a half hour film.",20,0.057777778,0.204305556,11/2/24 4:55

They could've called her their sister but they stuck to calling him their brother and a guy who was wronged.

Who would've thought that Kartik will beat half of the bollywood that too with less screens... Also, he has beaten Akshay's highest grosser Housefull 4... It would be fun to watch if BB3 crosses Ajay's highest grosser Tanhaji which earned 280cr...I just hope he doesn't get too high on the success.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúSadly, Cyrotron is a scam praying on desperate families.  I really feel for your child, I wish he‚Äôll do better but this isn‚Äôt the solution.

There‚Äôs no scientific evidence backing up Cytotron. Unfortunately the movie is promoting things that aren‚Äôt true. One of the Cytotrons was provided to a Mexican hospital that stopped the study due to lack of positive results. Another company, Cytotronics, say they have a study but 4 years later they haven‚Äôt published it, which is quite unusual (and quite telling).

But Aranmanai is positioned as a family movie and Thangalaan is a meta movie which has magical realism but isn‚Äôt for children, it has elements of adventurism but again the movie isn‚Äôt exactly Temple of Doom either. See how Thangalaan cancels genres which causes its positioning to be vague and unstable, a bit like Selva‚Äôs Ayirithil Oruvan. Neither Indiana Jones nor Last Samurai. 

1. The tolerance levels of family audience is such that if a movie is a mediocre they‚Äôll still watch it if the movie has all the elements (comedy, conservatism and hero winning at the end). Aranmanai isn‚Äôt exactly Stree2, but that‚Äôs the pattern. Only an outright crap movie like Chandramukhi2 will bite the dust. Also the brand of Sundar C is a much bigger BO draw than some tier 2 heroes. 

2. When Pa. Ranjith‚Äôs movie releases, already a huge section of audience have already decided not to watch it. The same section of audience would again probably watch Vetrimaaran‚Äôs movies like Asuran or social justice movies like Jai Bhim. Their problem isn‚Äôt the mainstream narrative of the fact that ‚Äúdiscrimination is happening against certain groups of people‚Äù but rather with Ranjith‚Äôs narratives that ‚Äúcertain groups of people are all evil‚Äù.",23,-0.023057644,0.571115288,8/25/24 22:06

The plot armour of the characters is beyond absurd, like they're going up against fucking sub machine guns. The guns which fire bullets that will basically eviscerate any part of a human if made contact with. And they are going against this with fucking rifles??

Rifle Club,MalayalamMovies,Does Rifle Club breaks Chekhov's Gun rule. ,"You're misunderstanding the principle (it's not a rule). It's not that if a gun is present in the background of story it must be fired. It's that there must be a reason for it otherwise it's useless information that adds nothing to the narrative. The reason can be anything including subverting our expected reason. You can use the gun to hit someone over the head. You can have the gun jam in the climax. The gun can turn out to be a prop. The gun can also just be a symbol of something and not used like a gun at all.

In Rifle Club there are three reasons for the armoury. 

One is the obvious subversion of audience expectation and a subtle jab at the machine gun climax cliche. 

The second is that the armoury turning out to be empty increases the stakes for the club because the club are the better gunmen and if they also have an armoury then the moment they open it it's over. The movie keeps increasing the stakes for the heroes. This is a valid way to use a Chekhov's Gun. 

The third is symbolic. The armoury being moved to a safe place where it can not actually be used as intended basically makes it a glorified show piece which is also what the club is at this point. You've got all these great gunslingers born too late to actually be useful. Their skills, while impressive, are all just for show at this point. Suddenly they're caught in a situation where it's actually useful. Even Vijayaraghavan agrees that he wished for a situation like this all his life. The armoury is who they were, legendary but kinda useless. In the end they prove their worth with limited resources and older guns instead of simply relying on their reputation or some over powered weaponry.",28,0.123412698,0.361805556,1/5/25 0:18

Shotgun Wedding,weddingshaming,This ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù wedding,"Edit:  Okay so, now after going through the 500 some odd comments one by one (I may have missed some don't kill me).  If we don't follow the rules bellow the topic gets locked for good.

First this is this is wedding shaming, not body shaming.  No more comments about the bride's weight OR the groom's weight, or really anyone in any picture.  They will be removed, please report if you see anymore.

Second thing let's not poor or budget shame these people.  That being said, that doesn't mean that all budget friendly weddings have to be like this.  It is okay to not like their taste or comment on their taste.  The sidebar description does say shaming themes and a shot gun wedding themed wedding is permissible to raise eyebrows at.  We have a tacky flair for a reason, while I understand that calling this trashy is very harsh, there are ""tacky/trashy"" elements to it (the gun being pointed at a pregnant woman).  Just keep in mind not to call it trashy or tacky because of the budget.

Thirdly, not everyone is every going to agree on what is or isn't a tacky or badly themed wedding.  If you disagree, you can post you don't think it deserved to be shamed.

Fourth, as it says in the sidebar, no name calling or personal attack.  We can all disagree civilly without doing these things.  If you notice someone doing it, just report and walk away, do not engage in the same bahaviour back at them.  Just have to underscore it because some disagreements devolved into it, and some were quite civil.  Keep your cool, take a moment to breath before replying in a haste.

There is no doubt that there are Jihadists or Muslim extremists in Kashmir, but this movie is trying to do the same thing as The Kashmir Files.

Funny thing about Indian movie censorship is that, obviously, they will allow nonsensical movies like this, but hey, don‚Äôt dare to talk about Eelam Tamils or the LTTE in a positive light, or you will be cut short. For people wondering what I‚Äôm trying to say: in the past decades, there were so many movies that tried to do this, but the movies were never released, or the directors were banned in Kollywood. Even a movie that came recently ‚Äî it‚Äôs called Meiyazhagan. In one scene, he talks about Eelam and the Cholas, and the scenes were cut short.

Vicky Vidya ka Woh Wala Video,BollyBlindsNGossip,Reviews Megathread - Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video,"Good first half, could've done without a few scenes especially some of the meta jokes(Khichdi banaadi funny ke naam par).

The cast was the saving grace. RKR, Vijay Raaz, Tiku Talsania, Archana Puran Singh and Malika Sherawat are all the GOATS of comedy so I knew I'd have a good laugh.

For me the surprise element was Triptii Dimri's comic timing who I found awfully unfunny in Bad Newz. Unpopular opinion but she's actually very commercial film material. She and RKR also had great chemistry, would love to see them in a better made rom com soon.

The second half should've been deleted cuz it was so meh but the climax was pretty good with a good message that should've been set up better in the first half for payoff.

I'd give it a 5/10.",15,0.184782609,0.49057971,10/13/24 1:21

Sikandar Ka Muqaddar,bollywood,Rewatched Muqaddar Ka Sikandar; this shit is a masterpiece ü•Ä,"*Muqaddar Ka Sikandar* is a masterpiece that's stood the test of time with its writing, filming and performances, was one of the top three highest grossers of its time, in the decade of the '70s, after *Sholay* and along with *Bobby*, and thus falls in the rare category of critically acclaimed blockbusters. It's also around this time that industry insiders and trade magazines like boxofficeindia suggest that Bachchan became the undisputed number one star of bollywood, toppling Dharmendra, consolidating the stardom that had begun five years ago and beginning a reign at the top that would lead to him being called one-man industry soon thereafter. 

As Sikandar, Bachchan is simply phenomenal. It's the greatest performance by our greatest ever actor and, for me, the best rendition of *Devdas* on screen thus far, though Kader Khan's treatment took Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's eponymous novel and its characters only as a starting point and infused the foundation with elements from the maker Prakash Mehra's own life, just the way I like adaptations to be. 

In the film, Bachchan is always a different person with Zohra and with Kaamna and he's never out of tune yet the various segues in and out of confidence to diffidence are so breathtakingly brilliant, keeping in mind that films in those days were shot non-chronologically and with multiple shifts on other films as well. The monologue before *O Saathi Re* is delivered with devastating accomplishment by Bachchan and his expressions during the Kishore Kumar classic that follows comprise a masterclass in restraint where the subtlest changes of expression complement the minutest of inflections and bring out the character's endless pain. Another memorable scene is the one where Sikandar visits Zohra just after he has seen Kaamna and Vishal just to find that she has closed the door on him. ""*Kaun Sikandar*?"" she asks when he asks for him. What follows is a reinterpretation of *Darwaaza Kholo Paro* done at the highest level. One has to see it to believe it. As Bachchan moves through desperation to sadness to anger in seconds, he leaves no doubt as to his genius.",7,0.218115942,0.621376812,6/2/25 1:46

It was almost like they took a step back, as the enemy this time was like fish in a barrel to ol McCall.  This was absolutely nothing compared to what he's faced in previous movies.  

It was sort of a celebration of him, of finding peace.  It felt like an action movie for old folks who also appreciate finding peace in their older days, & I felt that.  I can appreciate it, but I will say that it could have used a bit more of the gritty action & higher stakes we had in previous films.

>**Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies**. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. **They delight in acting in bad faith**, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

Musk and Robinson know they are doing Nazi salutes. The people defending them know they are doing Nazi salutes. It's plain as day what they are doing. They simply delight in acting in bad faith, and love to take advantage of those who feel obligated to try to take them in good faith. You know they were doing Nazi salutes.

M3GAN,boxoffice,"‚ÄòM3GAN 2.0‚Äô LGBTQ+-focused marketing: How ‚ÄòM3GAN 2.0‚Äô Doubled Down on its Very Gay, Very Online Fanbase","The marketing for M3GAN 2.0 has always felt miscalculated to me, although I wish them the best and I hope the film is A: good, and B: a success.

It sorta feels like they've ended up trying to imitate Terminator 3 -- there's an evil female robot that is killing her way down a list -- without really appreciating why Terminator 3 was the way it was. Terminator 3 is the result of a complex tug of war between its leader writer who hated Terminator 2 with a passion and considered it a betrayal of everything Terminator stood for, and the studio, who really liked Terminator 2 and wanted more of that.

It's a very long story including script doctors inserting a bunch of gags that had been firmly rejected by the lead writer. But you know what? The end result is a film that strangely works because its camp tone, the callbacks to T2 that unintentionally (the studio and script doctors were not aware of Brancato's hatred for T2 when they inserted lines like ""she'll be back"") feel more scornful than loving, winds up distracting the audience so that they are absolutely blindsided by the ending, which was written out of pure spite because the writer wanted to invalidate Terminator 2 thematically and restore, as he saw it, the thematic integrity of the first movie.

I highly doubt M3GAN 2.0 is going to have a shocking, ""people are still talking about it 2 decades later"" ending where the audience's expectations are completely subverted. Also, Terminator 3 was a stupidly expensive film that ran out of money during production and had to have its star pay for the absolutely amazing ambulance chase sequence. M3GAN 2.0 is trying to be this big action movie, but it's clearly underbudgeted. The first movie made effective use of its budget. It spent that money wisely and it's a good looking movie. Here, the movie looks overstretched and cheap, and ""Hold onto your vaginas"" followed by some extremely ropey action CG is not a great marketing angle. It makes the film feel like a mediocre SNL parody of itself.

I think the broad problem here is that M3GAN was popular because it's a fun, approachable horror movie. It's a kind of entry point horror. The decision to make the theatrical cut PG-13 was really important because it positioned it as vaguely family friendly. It was a horror film for audiences that otherwise wouldn't watch a horror movie.

I do understand the logic at work here. It's very difficult for movies to cut through the noise. To make your film stand out. I think the bigger issue is not actually the marketing, but the film itself. How much has the film itself leaned into obnoxious try-hard camp? You can't manufacture camp. Camp is absolutely sincere. Megalopolis is camp because the film is incredibly stupid and also incredibly sincere. When you try to cynically make your film camp, the magic is lost.",11,0.085193623,0.516863027,6/13/25 23:24

Also there are some lines about feeling like life/death being inconsequential and blacking out (pavement is my pillow talk) which reminds me a lot about ketamine trips/holes, so possibly the narrator has substance abuse issues or is just a fan.

There's a lot to interpret obviously. To me, from a relatability standpoint, some of the stuff speaks towards losing who who wish you were or used to be before abusing some kind of vice.",2,0.266666667,0.633333333,11/1/24 19:27

So hes just trying to deal witht lifes duality, and it is like a massive conflict within him, like he is narrating this specific feeling through the whole album.

The Heart Knows,OldManDog,I scheduled all 3 of my elderly pups to cross the bridge tomorrow and it feels like the execution date for my heart. üíî I know you guys understand.,"It‚Äôs been past time for all of them - heart failure, pain management, etc. but this has been the worst fucking year ever. It would have happened weeks ago but we lost one family member 2 weeks ago and then my mom last week (I shepherded her through the end). I keep wanting to call my mom to cry about my dogs, and I‚Äôm losing them just as I need them to help me with the loss of my mom.

I don‚Äôt want to do it but Barley is already collapsing sometimes, Molly is starting to do the same, and Mr. G‚Äôs QOL is really limited by a neurological problem and a painful back. Spreading them out just means risking one of the others having a traumatic/catastrophic episode first.

This sucks, y‚Äôall. :(

Edit: Just a lil more detail - we‚Äôre having a vet come to the house, and both of my college-student kids will be here too to say goodbye. It was really difficult to decide who goes first, but I think it will be Barley because he gets really stressed out if something‚Äôs happening to the other dogs, like baths or grooming. Mr. G won‚Äôt really notice because he‚Äôs derpy. Molly won‚Äôt care as long as I‚Äôm snuggling her. :(

Their regular vet has agreed that it‚Äôs appropriate for all of them at this point. She put Barley on an aggressive meds plan a few weeks ago to try to give him more time for me to get through a major surgery, but he has heart attacks and we‚Äôre risking him having a really bad one by delaying the inevitable.

Can‚Äôt go around, so I guess we just push through. Thanks you guys. üíñ

Edit again: Thank you, thank you, thank you for all of the kind words and empathy, truly. I read every single reply and will be holding on to them as I spend this last night with my pups!

It's selfish to watch your best friend(s) suffer in so much pain, and keep them around just because you can't let them go. Sometimes ending their pain means taking on a huge one of your own. That's the greatest gift you can give them.

Our vet even said in these situations he usually will treat the most confident dog first (happened to be our grumpy terrier boy) so that they can be a guide for the more nervous dog (our Great Dane that of course was a sweet little baby). That was really sweet of him to say/do and it made me feel better (as much as you can in that situation).

American Made,movies,Official Discussion: American Made (International Thread) [SPOILERS],"I watched this movie last week and I like the movie, it was very enjoyable for me. 

Tom Cruise really enjoyed himself in this movie with those guns, drugs, and cash. He really captured that 80s euphoria. Doug Liman and Gary Spinelli also made this convoluted scandals campier than I expected and it has its own charm.

But some characters are kinda underused like Jesse Plemons' sheriff character. The Barry's family subplot is an afterthought in this movie.

Overall it is really entertaining despite its own flaws.

American Made,movies,Official Discussion: American Made (International Thread) [SPOILERS],"The film seemed to take a lot of queues from Scorsese, often just in an aesthetic sense with freeze-frames and narration. I also found that some of the scenes where Barry was dealing with particularly stressful situations, like JBs various screw-ups, reminded me of *Goodfellas* and Henry's final day as a Wiseguy.

So, in a sense it felt like a lot of the film had been done before... but goddamn if this wasn't a wonderfully fun execution of those familiar parts. It's great to see Cruise in a role that doesn't rely as strongly on his running ability, and hopefully this will lead to a return to more serious roles in the future. Domhnall Gleeson was great as Schafer, and having him start the Iran-Contra affair at the end was hilarious.

Not every movie needs to spoon-feed you The Meaning of Life‚Ñ¢ or have a tragic, introspective protagonist with deep existential dread to be worthwhile.

Aside from *Jumper* (and from what I heard about *Chaos Walking* that seems to be a similar misfire), Doug Liman proved to be a pretty accomplished director in blockbusters. He and Cruise did well on *Edge of Tomorrow*, so it made sense to reunite them. And while I prefer *Edge*, *American Made* proved to be very entertaining nonetheless. Solid performances (good enough to redeem Cruise's rare godawdul turn in *The Mummy* the same year), slick editing, good use of handheld camera work, an engaging story about drug delivery by plane... it's the kind of blockbuster I watch movies for, even if it's all a bit broad to be the greatest thing ever.",8,0.278472222,0.55125,12/24/21 11:59

A few notes:

* **Welcome to the Sticks** has its pre-release week in northern France included its opening day. Otherwise, it would be 3^(rd) with 558,359 admissions.
* Most of the biggest opening days have a sizable number of admissions made in preview showings. Usually, it's between 100 to 300k.
* Also, most of these record OD have been made in late January or February, to coincide with the winter holidays. Five movies weren't released in that period:
   * Taxi 2, released late March for the Easter Holiday
   * Little White Lies 2, released on Labor Day (May 1^(st) in France)
   * Camping 3, released late June for the Summer Holiday (and coinciding with the National Cinema Fest where all tickets are in reduced price)
   * Valerian, released as a summer blockbuster (only english-language film in the bunch)
   * Kaamelott: First Installment, which benefitted from hype (it was awaited for several years!) but also from unique circumstances: 11 days prior, the government asked a Vaccine Pass to be put in effect on July 21, requiring two shots of the vaccine to be able to attend theaters. At this point, 50% of the population (and 75% of the 18-49 demographic) didn't have their two doses yet, so July 20 was the last day where they could attend theaters without vaccine restrictions. And so, Kaamelott did a wide preview showing on July 20, establishing a record with 310k admissions in preview showings.",9,0.055729167,0.415625,2/2/23 3:49

Ast√©rix & Ob√©lix: The Middle Kingdom,boxoffice,Weekend Box-office ESTIMATES | February 1-5 | AST√âRIX & OB√âLIX: THE MIDDLE KINGDOM gets the best opening for a french movie since 2019 and dethrones AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER which will reach the 13M admissions mark. BABYLON also hits 1M admissions!,"To add some detail:

* **Ast√©rix & Ob√©lix: The Middle Kingdom** (aka **Ast√©rix 5**) still does a lower 5-day opening compared to **The Magic Tuche** in 2018 (1.98M) and **Serial Bad Weddings 2** in 2019 (1.85M). Poor critics could have had an influence, but as the winter school holiday didn't quite start yet, many people are waiting for the holiday to go see it and judge by themselves.
   * Note that in France, winter and easter school holidays are spread out over four weeks, but only a part of the population is concerned at any given time - France is divided between three zones, and each zone is in holiday for two weeks, overlapping each other.
* **Avatar: The Way of Water** is going to hit 13M today - the holiday will help it going to 14M. It will probably do a bit less than the first Avatar, but it's still a massive achievement.
* France still gives a warm welcome to Damien Chazelle and **Babylon** is the third movie of the year to hit 1M admissions after Father & Soldier and Ast√©rix 5. Quite likely to finish over 1.5M admissions.
* **Knock at the Cabin** is doing a stronger start compared to Old, which suffered from the vaccine pass (mandatory to attend theaters) in July 2021. But it's quite far from Split and Glass which did much stronger openings. It was clearly overshadowed by the massive marketing campaign for Ast√©rix.
* **Vaincre ou mourir**, the catholic alt-historic movie gets the lowest drop of the top 10 with only 10% less attendance compared to the previous week.",4,0.087,0.546333333,2/6/23 4:16

PS: It was unwatchably bad.

For what it's worth, my (sold-out) audience kind of challenged my theory that we're seeing the birth of French Pureflix. Yes, there was an older group of 15 people that that might've come because their church handed-out tickets. Honestly though, the audience was overwhelmingly 18-30 males, noticeable off-duty military/police guys, who probably thought they were getting anti-lib swashbuckling action, not solemn resentment porn. Church group gave the film a standing ovation and those poor dudes seemed really bored.

* **Alibi.com** **2** had 80k admissions in previews and managed to keep the lead with 50k admissions to spare. It was even with **Ast√©rix 5** the whole weekend. 2M admissions are practically given and it might even hit 3M if there's low drops over the weeks. Its Allocin√© audience score (4.0/5) will definitely help.
* With such competition, **Ast√©rix** dropped by 46% despite the beginning of the school break. Its 6M admissions objective seems to be near impossible now, and 5M are heavily compromised.
* **Avatar: The Way of Water** falls to 3rd and will try to reach 14M admissions at the end of its career. **Titanic** will cross 22M total thanks to its re-release. Cameron rules in France.
* **Babylon** is heading towards 1.5M admissions, which would bring a gross revenue very close to the US release.
* Family movies **Mummies** and **Princes of the Desert** both fail to reach a large audience, already massively taken by **Alibi.com** **2** and **Ast√©rix 5**, alongside the insane career of **Puss in Boots 2**.
* **Knock at the Cabin** is nearly out of the top 10 and will finish its career just above 200k admissions.",5,-0.016017316,0.417207792,2/13/23 4:29

They price it unreasonably at first and they fully expect us to revolt. 
  
After the revolt they will give the ol 'We took your feeback blah blah' bit and ""revise"" the pricing to something more reasonable. 
 
Now the community will be happy with the ""new price"" 
 
But of course the intention was to introduce a pricing model all along. The ~~exuberant~~ exorbitant price was bait to make the actual price more acceptable.  
  
If they initially announced the better price the community would be against any sort of pricing and demand it be free forever, but this way they can sneak in a pricing model

I've gone through >10 accounts over the last 11ish years (back when ""when does the narwhal bacon"" was actually cool), and witnessed a whole bunch of changes to reddit. Of all the ""reddit better change X or we'll stop using it"" protests, this is by far the most likely to succeed because it's not based on ideological opposition to any individual staff/admin, or moral support for mods. It materially affects me, the end-user.

If a reddit admin has questionable morals, the way I use the site doesn't actually change. If reddit's mod tools suck, the way I use the site doesnt actually change (unless/until moderation quality goes down, but even then its an indirect effect). But as someone who's been using a third party app forever, tried the official app and given up on it, shutting down third party apps means I'll pretty much not be able to use the site.

When yelp made it hard to view reviews without downloading their app, I didn't download their app, I just stopped using yelp. When TripAdvisor did the same, I didn't download the app, I just stopped posting reviews.

For me, this isn't a ""change X or I'll protest by voluntarily stopping my use of reddit"". It's ""change X or I will have no good way of using the site"".

I'm sure reddit has stats showing that folks like me are in the minority and they can afford to lose me, so I'm just waiting for the day my Sync for Reddit app stops working. It's already getting exhausting trying to figure out if that post was stealth marketing or if that comment was posted by a bot.

Priest,turtlewow,Soooooo many priests!,">*Barely any warriors though. I guess we'll be healing hunter pets.*

**I play all 4 Tank classes.  Here's the problem in a nutshell -**

.. Tanking has *always* been scarce because it's not a build as much as it's a *mindset.* It takes a special person who thoroughly understands the game, remembers the dungeon / raid map, monster abilities, and can provide a small bit of leadership.  Accordingly, tanks have always been scarce.

Turtle has exacerbated the scarcity problem.  The most recent class adjustments nerfed Feral Druid tanks, and did nothing to address the way, *way* back in 4th place and still struggling Enhance Shaman tanks.  They are not only *no fun to play,* but are *deficient.*

DPS is so broadly OP now that dungeon tanking is a huge pain the ass, with DPS classes ripping threat of the tank on group pulls quite often.  After 20 years players still ignore marks, have no idea what they even mean, and when explained still ignore them.  Two seconds into every pull there's still some level 40 Enhance Windfury Shaman with a rare 2-hand weapon attacking the X, or a mob that's not even marked.

If you've wondered why every asshole on the server is rolling a Paladin, you have your answer.  You can just Salvation the entire party, Seal of Wisdom yourself, Consecrate and Holy Strike while sipping coffee.  There is absolutely *no* parity between their ease of holding Threat while having excellent mitigation when compared to other classes.  A well geared / well played Warrior is a close second in the 30-59 range, but only by virtue of being busier than a 1-legged monkey in an ass kicking contest.  Non-stop Sunder tabbing, Shield Slam, Revenge, Concussion Blow, Battle Shout & Thunderclap spam on multi mob pulls -  the APM is astronomically higher than Paladin tanking and **fucking** ***exhausting.***

Turtle needs to *encourage* more players to learn good, effective tanking and *play tanks -* **not** throw uneven class design obstacles in front of players.",41,0.087315271,0.504187192,2/15/25 17:53

I can't recall the episode, but the representation of the selection for naive T cells in the thymus is actually really accurate. Cells that recognise self antigens are killed, or you'd have an inflammatory reaction against your own body (that's what autoimmune diseases are about, btw). Cells that can't recognise non self antigens well enough are killed, cause they would be useless (though they're sometimes ""recycled"", they get a second chance to make an antigen receptor with a higher affinity; if they can't, they're killed). 

Cancer cells' only fault might be to be born, but that's bad enough for you. If the body can't kill them, they proliferate and that's when a tumor starts forming",81,0.003125,0.4625,6/18/20 16:42

Perayaan Mati Rasa,finansial,MANUAL ANTI TIPU-TIPU ASURANSI: SEMUA YANG AGEN ASURANSI GAK MAU LO TAHU.,"Good write up, mate. Gw nambah dikit ya. 

1. Tekankan pada baca polis, itu definisi satu perusahaan dengan perusahaan lain bisa beda. Pastiin juga sama syarat claim, contoh ada syaratnya ""serangan jantung pertama"" sama ""serangan jantung"" ini hati-hati, sekilas sama tapi kondisi pertama lebih ketat

2. Sekarang ada yang modelnya pertanggungan tetep turun, tapi di umur sekian (biasanya tua banget). Tetep kalah sama inflasi. 

3. Ada yang namanya free look. Please, read your policy during this period. Batalin polisnya kalo lu merasa ga sreg sama polisnya dalam masa ini. Dalam masa ini kalo lu batalin premi lu balik, di luar masa ini dianggap lu surrender polis. 

4. Jujur aja pas beli asuransi jangan bohong mengenai kesehatan, rekam medis lu jangan disembunyiin. Perusahaan asuransi akan bisa dapet rekam medis lu kalau lu kena investigasi. Investigasi ini kena kalo lu claim di bawah 2 tahun DAN kalo claim lu ga normal (3 kali di tahun yang sama dengan penyakit sama, tiap perusahaan bisa beda. Tanya agent lu kalo punya).",34,0.416666667,0.683333333,6/21/25 22:26

The Demon's Bride,AmIOverreacting,FinalUpdate: AIO? My fianc√© asked me not to wear white to our wedding.,"WOW. 

Good for you guys for handling this like champs. A couple thoughts: 

MIL will likely try to show up / escalate / break NC at just about any cost. If you don‚Äôt have a video doorbell, I‚Äôd recommend one. She might also track him down at work or rally other family members to her cause. Remember that she lied really easily about how John treated her when you were RIGHT THERE - she is delusional and will not admit fault here. 

Also, if neither of you have done therapy before - sometimes therapists tell us some stuff that is hard to hear. It is also possible for therapists to be just bad at their jobs or out of touch - if you feel like the person you do a couple sessions with is invalidating you, it‚Äôs absolutely okay to find someone else. 

Lastly - going NC with a parent is so fucking hard. No matter what they‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs still SO hard to do. This might be really rough on John as he has made some really ugly realizations about his entire family dynamic this week and he might need you to be just a little more gentle than usual with him.

The Demon's Bride,BestofRedditorUpdates,OP‚Äôs wife admits to cheating thinking it doesn‚Äôt count since it was before their marriage.,"My father had the same type of conversation with me that OP's MIL had with her daughter. ""If you want to play around, do it before marriage"", he said. I remember just staring at him thinking ""what kind of shitty advice is that?"". I said I had no intention of ever cheating on my SO, whichever our marital status was, because I knew better than that. He nodded and I thought that was that. However, that whole thing left me with a very bad feeling. I didn't want to believe my father was capable of cheating on my mother (who is an hopelessly romantic and loyal person), but unfortunately I didn't need to wait a long time before shit hit the fan and it came to our knowledge that not only he cheated, he even failed to follow his own advice.

The Demon's Bride,BestofRedditorUpdates,OP‚Äôs wife admits to cheating thinking it doesn‚Äôt count since it was before their marriage.,"Man. Lots of layers in this.

I would have left immediately when she cheated on me before being engaged. So every thing after is a sham and a lie because she hid the affair.

I admit life is not black and white and after years of being married, I might not be able to let them go either.

But his wife. Jesus.

To spill every thing right before the wedding, to introduce the affair partner, intimately dance, the way she attacked him and talked shit to other people *before* they even left the wedding‚Ä¶.

I could never look at the woman who did all those things at her sister‚Äôs wedding the same.

ETA: Big Clock pointed out that OOP‚Äôs wife said the last time she saw her affair partner was 3 years ago. You know, right before they got married.

The Last 7 Days,GlowUps,(36) to (37) Quit binge eating/drinking and started working out 6/7 days for the last 8 months.,"Going to post this here since I got the same question more than once. Went from 245 to 195. 

I was going through a divorce and using alcohol and food to cope in unhealthy ways. I cut that out and started eating healthy and working out. I used to eat to the point of feeling sick and I loved it‚Ä¶I‚Äôd binge eat so much that I was pre diabetic and the insulin that my body was releasing to cope with the food was allowing me to sleep because I was in such a terrible place with my mental health at the time it seemed worth it. It most certainly was not. I realized I was prioritizing these 20-40 minutes a day of spend gorging myself to be disappointed the rest of the time. Now I fight a serious battle in that 20-40 minutes to eat correctly for my future self and I‚Äôm happy the rest of the time regarding this matter. Once I realized this, it was a simple decision even though that didn‚Äôt make it easy at first as my body really craved bad foods. 

For food, it was high protein diet where I got all my carbs from vegetables and fruits and I used minimal olive oil/avocado oil for cooking. I eat a lot of homemade chili for lunch where I double or triple the ground beef. I also eat fajitas a lot, but I only partake in the meat and veggies and leave the tortilla/sour cream alone. Steak, chicken, fish‚Ä¶what would our ancestors eat?

For alcohol, I was drinking 3-6 times a week and too much. Now I drink maybe 3-4 times a month and cap it around 3 drinks. I also realized during all this that alcohol isn‚Äôt really my friend and doesn‚Äôt serve me well in any capacity. 

For exercise I hit the gym Monday through Friday. 

Monday was legs, started with squats then did things like lunges, pistol squats, box jumps to further tear them down for about 50 minutes total. 

Tuesday was pull. I started with pull ups, try to get 10 and then break down the last with row and other pull exceeded, I had to use a band in the beginning, but now I can do full muscle ups. 

Wednesday was push. Started with bench, then further broke down with pushups/dips/ tricep actions and such. 

Wednesday was hiit day. I would do a body exercises such as burpees, box jumps, jump rope, run, push ups, pull ups, jumping jacks, planks for 40 seconds and then 20 second break. I would do this with 8 exercises and then after my 8th one I‚Äôd take a whole minute off, which puts you on a 10 minute circuit. Do that whole thing 4 times and the do a core exercise. 

Friday was leg day again focusing on deadlifts. I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough. The more you workout the larger muscle groups the faster you lose fat and your muscles need calories to exist, so the more muscle you have the more you NEED to eat in order to maintain. Not only do you get the calorie burn from the workout, but then that muscle will passively burn calories as it repairs itself over the next two days. All said and done regarding time input, you‚Äôll burn more calories than cardio overall.

The Last 7 Days,Eldenring,To this day I still wonder who the fuck decided to make black flame blade incantation last 7 SECOND.,"Playing devil's advocate and being probably one of the few people who genuinely tried to make this thing work, I sorta get what it was going for: it's a weapon buff meant for a seal'n'weapon playstyle that has its seal out at all times, taking advantage of the fact that it can be cast during a jump or out of a dodge. It's actually real nice with a Heavy Thrusting Sword-centric dex/faith build (since your dex increases its cast speed).

...But it's not strong enough to justify that style. The percentage-based damage is nice, it chows health bars, but not to the extent where a seven second duration (10 with Old Lord's) feels good. 0.7x damage per incant scaling plus 2% over 2 seconds, that's okay, but it doesn't stack like Bloodflame does, and percentage effects are nerfed in the DLC.

If it was something like a 1.0 damage per incant scaling, making it the hardest hitting and best scaling weapon buff in the game, *maybe* you'd have something to justify the short duration. As it stands, it's still fun to try and use, I like it, but it's clear it's not for everyone.",523,0.223958333,0.451041667,3/30/25 5:32

It's been a [zombie publication](https://newrepublic.com/article/158968/newsweek-rise-zombie-magazine) for at least a half a decade at this point. But in a lot of people's minds, it's still got the imprimatur of being one of the big two weekly news magazines alongside *Time*.

2016, Trump did not have a political record to attack.  A lot of people bought into the myth that he was a good businessman.  Hilary had years of service to cherry-pick failures from mixed with the fact she had the charisma of a dead squirrel.  It was a perfect storm.  

2024, anyone who didn‚Äôt cover their eyes saw how badly Trump mismanaged a pandemic, set the economy up for failure, and how unstable the executive branch was under his leadership.

Every few posts here are people that try to launch the 5000th petition. They dont work. Not a single one is actually communicated with Netflix, and Inside Job is simply over. 

A point that prooves Netflix disinterest is Final Space. 3 seasons, the final one was almost there. Netflix canceled it.

The creator managed to develop a visual novel book to tell the stories end. Thousands of people pre purchased this pretty expensive book, myself included.

Its a obvious af sign that people want this show. But netflix doesnt care",70,-0.041428571,0.497142857,10/1/24 14:12

Inside Job,InsideJob,Inside Job Revival,"As someone already mentioned, a network bringing back Futurama is a way to get into business with the guy who created The Simpsons.

Inside Job,InsideJob,Inside Job Revival,"Support TAG and the potential animation strike. Shion would bring the show back if she could but I think there are 1) issues with Netflix owning the rights and not selling 2) a general animation drought due to labor conditions and lack of greenlit projects 3) general logistic/timing issues with getting the staff back. Shion obviously didnt want the show to get canceled in the first place, but now that it has been, it's like starting over. She would need a lot of support from Hirsch (ideally) and other producers and execs in order to get it back into production. Never count it out, but Hollywood is an endurance game. We have to be able to wait it out. One distinction w Futurama is that that show was a massive success. Inside Job flew under the radar, despite its quality.

Lastly, I don't want you to feel like you are the only one who can fix this. As a matter of fact, we don't have much power. All we can do as fans is keep the conversation and hashtags going. Otherwise we have no say. It's not like the old days where writing in might get a network to pick up a show (at least I don't think it is? Does Netflix even have a PO Box?) I admire your proactivity and who knows? Maybe you will be able to achieve something we could not. But realistically, do not burn yourself out. There are very big powers at play and one person should not shoulder that burden.

Definitely keep up that energy, but don't forget to rest, too. Odds are this is just not the right time. It could be a long wait.

EDIT 1: I want to add that by all accounts, Inside Job was extraordinarily expensive by animation standards. Netflix greenlit the project, gave Shion a blank check, and basically said 'go ham' in the hopes of making lots of money. This is the way Netflix works as a company. I recommend reading an article about Netflix company culture for more info. That said, this is another barrier for production. I think Netflix might be the ONLY company able to AFFORD a show like Inside Job. Whether or not you agree that a show like this should've had a budget that size is besides the point. What matters is that right now studios are absolutely squeezing animation projects for every drop and not financing them like Netflix once financed Inside Job.   
  
Generally, I agree with Netflix giving IJ a big budget bc animated TV and movies make studios millions of dollars annually. For this reason, and from a culturally significant/artistic standpoint, I think all animation projects deserve more funding. Sam Deats talks about this a lot with Castlevania production vs. an Apple show like SEVERANCE. One episode of Severance had the budget of an entire season of Castlevania, which just isn't fair to animators who really need that budget and could make amazing TV with that kind of money. Animation as a medium deserves 10000x more respect than it's currently getting and THAT, too, is a very long road, despite how obvious it is to you, me, and everyone who's ever enjoyed animation.

TLDR: Animation deserves more funding (it's obvious to everyone except shareholders for some reason), Inside Job could come back with the right support, and it's important to pace yourself while you wait for that time to come.",11,0.153695055,0.478983516,9/3/24 20:47
