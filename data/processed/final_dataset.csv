BUT, heavy armor is great against ranged threats, which will save on your shield durability.

Light armor trades the catchpocket for better armor and stamina, with pretty alright heat protection (less than stillsuit). This is good armor for melee builds.

Stillsuits have best heat protection and catchpockets, so water is pretty much a non factor.

In Hagga Basin, there is enough water around to use whatever armor you like. In the Deep Desert, however, water is incredibly scarce (no dew, few enemies for blood). So water is a much more conscious decision late game.

Hope this helps.

>I just saw this movie, and I don't get it : is the ending anti climactic, or did I miss something? 

Not sure what you mean. All you need to know is that the bank robber girl was forced by the German Nazi bad guys to rob the bank because they had her brother. 

Instead she double crossed then (Nazi guys) and had the female fbi agent arrest them. 


>What's up with the mid credit scene? Revenge on the people who killed his brother?

Yup 

>What about the movie title? Does most wanted mean anything special, to the first movie perhaps?

It was the female bank robber lead code name. Other than that, not sure why the title 

>I absolutely loved the movie Inside man, but this one, damn it felt unfinished.

Not surprised. This felt like the Descent Part 2. Just a movie to wrap up the holes  and a lazy copy from the original as well.  That's what disappointed me the most about this one. It copied the negotiation and robbery from the first one. It made the twist at the end lacking. 

The movie was also boring. 

Agree with your Will Smith comparison because he was kind of cocky like his character from bad boys.

I know it sounds like I ripped this movie, but I didn't hate it. I enjoyed it for what it was. 5/10",10,-0.073928571,0.541084656,9/27/19 23:05,US,3/25/25,0,FALSE

If a case like this happened in real life it would not change a thing. Not a thing. All it does is give the family some money.

It doesn’t stop gun violence, it’s not going to ratify the 2nd amendment. It’s not going to change the way people think. There’s always going to be another gun company, another twisted maniac, and another shooting and another and another and another.

If you wanna have trials with this sort of outcome then we have to sue car manufacturers like Ford & GM for creating something that can be used to end innocent lives. Then food companies, and gas stations because they sell lottery tickets and unhealthy items which can lead to compulsive gambling or cancer & food poisoning. Alcohol, tobacco, bow companies, knife companies, tool companies since the screw driver is the third most commonly used deadly weapon. I can go on an on. 

You can’t say that’s different. Different how?? Almost anything can be used irresponsibly. It’s a human problem, not an item problem.

If you could wave your hand and make every gun on this planet disappear then tomorrow on the news they’ll be talking about a bombing, a stabbing,arson, a cross bow killing…etc etc etc. 

If man wants to kill he will figure out a way to do it. This movie was ridiculous, naive, immature, and further more, impossible. It’s just like throwing drug dealers in prison who sell a drug that kills somebody. People that do drugs love them and want them, and someone or something is always going to be there to provide it for them.

If we don't follow the rules bellow the topic gets locked for good.

First this is this is wedding shaming, not body shaming.  No more comments about the bride's weight OR the groom's weight, or really anyone in any picture.  They will be removed, please report if you see anymore.

Second thing let's not poor or budget shame these people.  That being said, that doesn't mean that all budget friendly weddings have to be like this.  It is okay to not like their taste or comment on their taste.  The sidebar description does say shaming themes and a shot gun wedding themed wedding is permissible to raise eyebrows at.  We have a tacky flair for a reason, while I understand that calling this trashy is very harsh, there are ""tacky/trashy"" elements to it (the gun being pointed at a pregnant woman).  Just keep in mind not to call it trashy or tacky because of the budget.

Thirdly, not everyone is every going to agree on what is or isn't a tacky or badly themed wedding.  If you disagree, you can post you don't think it deserved to be shamed.

Fourth, as it says in the sidebar, no name calling or personal attack.  We can all disagree civilly without doing these things.  If you notice someone doing it, just report and walk away, do not engage in the same bahaviour back at them.  Just have to underscore it because some disagreements devolved into it, and some were quite civil.  Keep your cool, take a moment to breath before replying in a haste.

Last of all, guys this took me twice as long because a lot of people were in fight mode about getting modded.  Please respond to the message removal alert politely, without name calling the mods for doing it and we will discuss it with you.

**Pros:** Good acting from the two leads, and honestly production values were surprisingly high for a stand-alone mid-budget film - it didn't look any worse than any of the Netflix films that have come out this year.

**Cons:** The plot was unrealistic with one man killing over 50 people including trained cops, and not even sustaining a scratch on himself. Also, he commits these murders in places with plenty of cameras such as a mall and apparently no one is able to find him except a rookie cop and a FBI agent?!
